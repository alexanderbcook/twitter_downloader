Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.

The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.

Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?

This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.

I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.

And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.

We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.

We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.
Thank you. It’s great to be here in Charlotte. I just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.

I’d like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.

We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt – and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.

Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.

We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.

Tonight, I’d like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.
Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.

On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.

On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.

Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.

The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end – and it will end very quickly.

Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.

To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.

We cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.

Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.

Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.

But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.

As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I’ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I’ve never been politically correct – it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.

Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don’t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.

But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.

I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn’t have a voice.

I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.

I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need – and so many are not making it. They are dying.

I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.

Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals – who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don’t hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.

These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.

I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.

Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I’ve worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.

Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn’t just the fight of my life, it’s the fight of our lives – together – to save our country.

I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.

Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn’t graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.

When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.

In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.

If something isn’t working, you replace it.

If a product doesn’t deliver, you make a change.

I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

That’s why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always – and I mean always – come first.

Aren’t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?

Aren’t you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.

Aren’t you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?

That is all about to change – and it’s about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.

I’ve travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.

In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone’s interests ahead of yours.

And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.

I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign – nobody else is.

My only interest is the American people.

So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.

The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she’s told to them, and the many times she’s betrayed them.

Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?

Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?

Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?

Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?

Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don’t pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages – openly and blatantly – just like he lied about Obamacare.

Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama’s Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.

Let’s talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.

Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization – another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.

Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you’ll get that apology around the same time you’ll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.

Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I’ve spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.

I’ve embraced the crying parents who’ve lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.

My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.

But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?

Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?

These moms and dads don’t get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don’t get apologies. They’ll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.

But they will always come first to me.

Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.

Hillary Clinton’s mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.

Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.

Instead, I will be a champion for the people.

The establishment media doesn’t cover what really matters in this country, or what’s really going on in people’s lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.

Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed – she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.

Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.

Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.

Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It’s the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it’s been rigged against.

So many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.

So again, it’s not about me. It’s never been about me. It’s about all the people in this country who don’t have a voice.

I am running to be their voice.

I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.

I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again – including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.

There’s a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.

It’s the powerful protecting the powerful.

The insiders fighting for the insiders.

I am fighting for you.

Here is the change I propose.

On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.

We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.

On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn’t share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.

We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.

My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America’s Angela Merkel, and we’ve seen how much crime and how many problems that’s caused the German people.

We have enough problems already, we don’t need another one.

On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.

The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.

On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.

Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.

On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses – creating millions of new good paying jobs.

We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.

On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn’t care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.

We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities – and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.

On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare – at a much lower cost.

On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.

In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.

I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.

I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.

Finally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.

If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership – look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.

What do you have to lose by trying something new? – I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.

Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.

It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.

In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.

But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.

72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.

It is time to vote for a New American Future.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make American Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, We Will Make America Great Again.
The crowds we’re getting — I’m the messenger, but I’ll tell you what, the message is the right message. We’re tired of incompetence. We’re tired of not taking care of our military. We’re tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.
We’re tired of so many different things. And this is what happens. So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I’m telling you, he said, “I don’t believe this. This is incredible.”
And what he hasn’t seen, and your governor, by the way, who’s a great guy. And he’s now seeing it, they’re walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can’t get in. I said, “Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside.”
So I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here. And we are going to have a good time. We love North Carolina. We love North Carolina.
We did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now. We have to win. That November 8 day is so important.
You know, I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices, we have to get – you know, you could have as many as four? I guess it’s a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.
And if you pick two that are left, left, left, it’s going to be a disaster for our country. Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago. And they’re great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people.
But if you – if you do something with these – I’ll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia. We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that’s going to happen. It is so important.
So if for no other reason, I mean it’s such an important – it’s one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons. But that’s so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency. This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do . Believe me, I’ll make you very proud of those Justices everyday.
So we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million – all cash, right — $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like? That’s a lot of cash. That’s a lot of case.
And honestly, it’s so sad. Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state. Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we’ve given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know – I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.
Now, a lot of people say, “no, no, it’s used for terror,” and they use it for terror because it’s the number one terror funder – not even close. But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all. They released pictures.
And interesting I’ll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right? You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that. You can do a lot of things.
And Obama said that he did it because we don’t have a working account with Iran. Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You don’t have a working account, you set up an account, right?
You set up an account and it takes about – look, what’s going on in this country – folks, folks, what’s going on in this country is insane. And we have people running our country that don’t know what they’re doing, they’re grossly incompetent, and it’s time. We have to make change, real change. Not Obama change, we have to make change.
Whether it’s Bergdahl (ph), we get Bergdahl (ph) who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they’ve wanted for eight years. We get Bergdahl — I call it the five for one trade. For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.
They get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they’ll get way, way earlier than that. They’ll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you’re going to see a lot of changes to that deal. That’ll happen fast.
You’re going to see some big changes and what I really — I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right? It really doesn’t work, does it? Does it? I mean, remember Obamacare, “you’re going to keep your doctor, you’re going to keep your plan, over and over again, you’re going to keep your doctor.” It was a lie.
And in fact, if he didn’t make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn’t want to do it. It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it. And it was a lie.
And the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn’t leave the airport until this other plane arrived. They don’t know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why. It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie. And it’s so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse. Maybe worse. There’ll be four more years. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. You know yesterday I had a — at a big event, really. It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit and…
Good event, very good. And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments. But the thing I’m doing, I’m cutting taxes big league. Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses. Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period.
Businesses are leaving our country like they’ve never left before. They’re going all over. They’re going to Mexico, that I can tell you. Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. You know I’ve been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy. He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them. Massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing?
And he’s worked in North Carolina, by the way. I said to him, how are you doing? He said phenomenal. He’s like, “I think the biggest in the world at this -” that’s what he does. Great guy. I said how’s it all going? He said, ‘you’ve got to see Mexico, Donald. It’s the eighth wonder of the world. What we’re building there is like, never has been built. We’ve never seen anything like it”.
And I said, how are we doing in the United States? I’m more interested in that, OK? It’s OK I guess. Right? You know, America first, folks. America first. America.
America first. We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen. It’s just not that they want other countries to benefit over us. There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I’m putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I’m funding me.
And I’m raising for the Republican party. And we’re getting a lot of money from the small donors.
Remember two months ago? Well, I hadn’t started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?
Let me get the nomination, please. And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world’s most dishonest people, by the way.
Terrible.
Those cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium. Those cameras — those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota (ph)? Any protesters?
If we had a protester that’s the only time they move because they’re showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move. But I like that, I’ve always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd.You know, I go home to my wife, I say how’s it going? She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there? I say yeah, about 7,000. That’s a small group.
Its only confined — I mean you had to see outside. I felt so badly — I came up — I came up — thank you and I love you too. Who said that? Who said that, huh? Thank you, thank you. But I came up with Rudy from New York and we’re driving up and we’re going block after block after block the line. And I said are those people going to be able to get in?
They said the place is already full. And Rudy just said man; I’ve never seen anything like that. Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what’s happening. Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks.
Because people are so tired of them. They’re so tired of them. So — and by the way — and by the way, voter ID, watch with that. Watch with voter ID, why aren’t we having voter ID? In other words, I wanna vote, here’s my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary.
Well — and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, OK? You won’t vote 15 times. But people will, they’ll vote many times and how that could’ve happened , it’s unbelievable. And the governor just told me that they’re going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay. Let’s see what happens, OK? Let’s see what happens. That’s a very important thing. But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important — yes, darling thank you. Unstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right? And nobody said anything about it, no problem. He said you lack judgment. And — during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine. When I say it they say that’s terrible the way you talk. She does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I’m the one that used unfit many, many months ago. And now they’ve turned it around, use it on me, unfit? I’m unfit? That’s — that’s a first. But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple. She really does. She’s a dangerous person who doesn’t tell the truth which has been proven very loudly. I’ve never seen a — I don’t think we’ve ever had greater proof of that, of anybody. And she has disregarded the lives of Americans — you see what’s happening — with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that. So, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within. Remember that. Remember that.

She will — she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks. You look at what’s going on in the world — look at France; take a good look at France. I have friends that go to France. They used to love France. They say, no thank you. They don’t expect to be going back anytime for a long time.
I have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France? He said, France isn’t France anymore. We’re not going. And so many people are saying that.
Look at what’s going on with Germany. Look at what’s happening with Germany. Look at the crime; look at the problems. We have enough problems in our country right now. We don’t need additional problems, folks. We don’t need additional problems.
And for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse. This could be. We don’t know who these people are.
Now, they’re coming in through Obama. And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it’s like for years, it’s sort of like this, a little uptick. And the last number or period of time, it’s like, “Wah, wah, wah, wah.” There — I have never seen anything like it.
They’re letting them in, and again, you can’t vet them. You don’t know where they come from. We don’t know — look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy — the woman coming in. Look at the damage in Orlando. Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job. And you know what he was screaming? He’s screaming what they all scream.
And we have to get smart, folks. We don’t need the problems — and we’ve already got those problems, just so you understand. Because they’re coming into the country, they’re being put where nobody even knows where they are.
It’s like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can’t believe they’re that stupid. They’re taking my people and they’re putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here.
Our military cannot be beaten. But you know what could happen? When we don’t know where they are, where they’re coming, you’ve them all over the place.
And folks, it’s some. You don’t need many; you don’t need many. One person in Orlando. Two people — look at in France, 130. Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris. One hundred and thirty people killed, 130.
And I’ve said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks.
Would have been a whole different.
For those — for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different — and I’d go a step further. If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people.
If these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn’t have gone in in the first place, all right? All right? Gun free — what do you think of these gun- free zones?

Do you know what a gun-free zone is? That’s like — they study where the gun-free zones — if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story. Maybe it wouldn’t have even happened in the first place.
So they better not come here. They better not. They better not.
So recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago. A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited. Hey, could you imagine if I said that “I short circuited”?
They would be calling for my execution, — electric chair. They’d bring back the electric chair. It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me. But the Secret Service agent said, “She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,” right?
“From the bottom of my soul,” he said, “I know this to be true. Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions. OK?
Hey, you know, it’s one thing to make bad decisions. It’s another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions.
She is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn’t changed a bit. This is — that was the good thing. I couldn’t say the bad things. It was too much. Nobody would even — nobody would even believe it. You’ve got to see this book. Nobody would believe because it’s so terrible, so terrible. And she comes across like this woman — nice, easy — but she’s not. And — and she’s — listen — she’s not a leader, not a leader. And she is a liar.
Hey, hey — 33,000 e-mails are gone. OK? 33,000 e-mails are gone. They’re gone. How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails? Who sends 33,000 e-mails? I mean, 33 — do you know how many that is? I think that’s like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn’t matter. For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing.
And she’s so guilty. She’s so guilty.
I think it’s a tremendous blot in our country. I really mean that. I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences. I think it’s a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot. Just remember that.
But I just looked at this — the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera. Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Now, this is, like, unbelievable — 1.2.
Do you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. Now, what they do is they cut their currency. They devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States. Our money, our jobs. They make our product, they sell our product to us. No tax, no nothing, you devalue — see devaluing is sort of cheating.
You know, it’s sort of like cheating. Now I have great relationships with China. I’ve done great business with China, I’ve done really well with China. I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma’am.
Got to win — got to win North Carolina. Thank you.
Thank you. But they — it’s cheating, it’s really cheating. And when I look at these trade deals — it’s so sad — where we lose $800 billion — billion with B — dollars a year on trade with China alone, it’s $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion. This is year in and year out, it’s actually amazing that our country keeps going. But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they’re making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18.

And in many cases, they’re working two and three jobs, OK? But they’re making less money now than they made 18 years ago. And those stats come right out, real wages. They’re working harder, they’re getting older.
So in theory it’s supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you’re young, you don’t care. Get a little older, it’s like, oh by the way, how about me? I think I’m working harder too, if you want to know.
I never worked this hard in my life. But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I’ve met so many incredible people. You know I really got — thank you — I really got a tremendous understanding of this country. Because I’m going to places that I’ve heard about, I’ve known about, I’m stopping everywhere. And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage. It’s been horrible. I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state. You look at New England. New England got really whacked. New England got hit.
You look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening. By the way, this isn’t like it’s going to happen or it’s all over, it’s getting worse. You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what’s going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable.
And more and more, you know they’re moving. We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday. Where they’ve lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it’s really not the car capital anymore. Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time. No, think of it.
And that’s only because we allow it to happen. And I like Mexico. And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they’re much smarter, they’re much street smarter, but they’re much smarter and more cunning than our leaders. But you have to see what’s going on. And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he’s the best, he’s the greatest.
But one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they’re building a plant in Mexico. And we’re not going to let it happen, folks. Look, right now as you stand here, you think you have great jobs. Companies are negotiating from North Carolina to move to Mexico, and other places. It’s not just Mexico, by the way. Made possible by our federal government, made possible by the people that enacted this suicidal pact.
It’s a suicidal pact for our country. And you know I’ve watched for years.
Can’t believe it.
But — but I’ve been watching for years and I’ve watched as — as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries. And I’ve seen low interest loans, I’ve seen zero interest loans, I’ve seen all sorts of subsidies.
I get it. That stuff’s not gonna work, that’s not gonna work. What’s gonna work is — as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant. I hope my friend bills it (ph), right?
And then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners — and then think they’re gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis — where they come from — for a similar price.
And they think they’re gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me, they have repercussions, OK?
With me, they have repercussions.
With me, we inform them that if you move, you’re gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders.
And two things are gonna happen, one of two things — one of two things are gonna happen. Number one, if you get them in time, they’re not moving. Throws it all off-balance, since they’re all off-kilter. Number one they’re not — now, nobody — people would say well, why doesn’t anybody use this? Why doesn’t anybody mention it?
I’ll tell you why. Because they’re controlled by their lobbyists, they’re politicians. And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this — I’m just using Carrier as an example. Its hundreds and thousands. Its thousands of company.
And millions of jobs we’re talking about. I was looking at numbers — I’m not gonna repeat the numbers because they’ll say I was wrong, it can’t be that high, I couldn’t believe it was that high. But it’s thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.
And you’d say why aren’t — like, why doesn’t somebody else say what Trump is saying? So I’m controlled by myself because I’m putting up my money, OK? I’m putting up my money.
And a lot of it — a lot of the money was the small donations which republicans never get. A lot of them — I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn’t raise any money.
And they told you why, right? I didn’t raise it because I didn’t know — I gotta make sure I got the nomination. If I didn’t get the nomination, I would’ve gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK?
In Scotland. But you know what? I got the nomination so now I had a start. And we raised $51 million in June, right? A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July.
People are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump — they said, that’s amazing. So we’re doing all right. And people look, they want — they wanna hear this message. Because this is a message this is an important message.
But when you say — and when you hear what I just said — you charge a tariff or a tax. And guess what? And people said why hasn’t the — why haven’t the politicians, they’re smart, why haven’t they done it?
Because they’re controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they’re not gonna do it. Whether it’s donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen.
And honestly, I think it’s a total disgrace.
I think it’s a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country. If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes — bye, bye.
They were so quiet. You know, I like the Hillary protesters. You know why? They’re so nice and quiet. The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. Right? The Hillary protesters had no spirit. Did you see that?
She starts screaming and the guy walks up, “I’ll go.”
The Bernie ones were — they had a lot more spirit. I think we’re going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth. Because they do understand that trade is killing us. Trade.
So, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing. One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it. That’s not a recovery. It’s probably much — don’t forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it’s lower. And 1.2 is starting to set records.
The national debt — so, we’re up to almost $20 trillion — $20 trillion! The national debt under Obama has doubled. Think of it, doubled. Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it’s going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurate.
Because I’ll say — they’ll say, well, it hasn’t quite doubled. Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.
The national debt has doubled. And you know the bad part about that? You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shape.
We’d have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country. And the roadways are a mess.
I have a friend, he’s in the trucking business. He said, you know, for years, he had no problem. Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had. So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you’d really think that we’d be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right? We’re not. We’re in very bad shape.
U.S. trade deficit, $800 — almost $800 billion. Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?
In the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force. Think of it. These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.
You know, you look for a job, you can’t find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever. You gave up, and now you’re considered — statistically, you’re considered employed.
Those people are not employed; these are great people. And there are plenty of them in here.
I mean, we have great people. We have the most loyal people. We have the smartest people. You know, so many of my people, they’re so smart. They like to say, well, Trump, I don’t know if he’s got this right — let me tell you, we have the smartest people. We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working.
We have the smartest people. We’ll put I.Q.s among — some of us, we couldn’t say all of us, right — against any I.Q.s that we — we have to deal with, that I can tell you. I would love to do that.
In the last seven years, 14 million. One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce. Pretty bad.
Homeownership — this is one that is amazing to me — today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.
So you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right? The American home.
Lowest that its been in so many years, 51 years. Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton — under Obama; because Clinton’s just gonna carry on.
You know, I don’t know if you saw. I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we’re gonna get rid of so many of them. But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she’s gonna double up your taxes.
And she’s trying to say well, I don’t know like Trump’s way — she’s gonna double up your taxes. You’re gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in. Enjoy — enjoy it folks, if that happens.
Fifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed. How sad is that? American households are earning $4,000 less — listen to this one, today — than they were 16 years ago. Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars.
So 1970 — that’s a long time ago, right? They’re earning in real dollars less money. So under my plan, we’re gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs. You know, it’s interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they’re bad jobs.
I’ve heard it from many of the people. They’re trying to defend him. But they say they’re bad jobs, they’re not good jobs. The good jobs — the good jobs have left. But we’ll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs.
That’s so important, that’s so important.
Everyone’s taxes will go down. Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career. She’s voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. That’s all? I thought it was more than that, 235 times. I hope there’s not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times.
But I don’t think there is — voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. Now, she’s planning another job killing — $1.3 trillion tax increase, that’s what her tax increase is gonna be, folks. Like you’re not paying enough, right?
Her plan will tax many small business — businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business. Then we have — we will make — and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK? My daughter, so great.
We’re gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families.
And just many, many other things. I mean, we’re gonna make some unbelievable changes and it’s — it’s so easy. Again, you know regulations — I’m traveling all over and I’m meeting with business owners — and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they’re being laid off because of it.
Regulations; if I told you — and I’m so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise — if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we’re gonna — you know, we’re bringing it down to 15 percent from more than — much more than double that.
But if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially — but in a real way — cut regulations — a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other. It’s amazing, its amazing.
And that surprised me. Surprised you too?
So great.
A hundred percent. I mean, everybody — businesses can’t form anymore, the tax — the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can’t form businesses — very hard — and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don’t do anything. We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations. We’re not, you know, people that don’t want these things. We have to have that.
We want clear air, we want clean water. We want clear water. But — but…
So you know, I just wrote this down today. Hillary wants to raise taxes. It’s a comparison. I want to lower them. Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league (ph). Can you believe that? I will reduce them very, very substantially. Could be as much as 70, 75 percent.
Hillary wants to shut down energy production. I want to expand it.
Lower electric — lower electric bills, folks. Hillary wants to abolish — essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick…
If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don’t know. But — but I’ll tell you what. That will be a horrible day. If — if Hillary gets to put her judges — right now, we’re tied. You see what’s going on.
XXX you see what’s going on? We tied because Scalia – this was not suppose to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing.
So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Now, speaking to the NRA folks – who are great – when you – when you — and I’ll tell you, they endorsed me.
Surprised him, too.

They endorsed me very early. My son’s a member. I’m a member.
If you – we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices – they almost go – in a certain way, hand in hand. Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected.And have gotten great. And they to a little equate – but if you don’t do the right thing, either you’re not going to have a Second Amendment or you’re not going to have much of it left. And you’re not going to be able to protect yourself, which you need.
You know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they’re not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this? OK, the bad guys aren’t going to be giving up their weapons.
But the good people will say, “oh, well, that’s the law.” No, no, not going to happen, we can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen.
Hillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country.
Where they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things. And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right?
So you have drugs pouring in. You have everything coming in.
You know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem. I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border. They’re going to stop.
Now here’s one and you know — I mean she doesn’t look that way, but she is — Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. That’s what she does and look at the mess. So we’ve spent — you know for two years, for three years, I’ve been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess. Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East.
And I’m going to get the accurate number. They don’t know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea. They have no idea what we’re doing. We’re sending equipment over, the enemies take it in. We sent over 2,300 humvees that are totally armor plated. They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300. I thought they meant like two or 23.
Or 230 was too much, 2,300 humvees and they got stolen. They got taken by the enemy. You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we’re trying to get out.
So, terrible. Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Big problem. Big problem. Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that’s wonderful, enjoy yourselves. I want to work with our police. Our police are so incredible, they’re not getting the respect they deserve.
And we’re going to, in our country, restore law and order. We have to, we have to restore law and order.
And the police are going to be careful and they’re going to be studied and they’re going to be — but we have to restore law and order. What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down. Absolutely, absolutely for no reason. Viciously shot down, and so many others. I was with one of the police groups the other day. They’re endorsing me.
And I said that was terrible in Dallas and they gave me a list of like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed. We have to respect and cherish our police.
School choice we want, common core we don’t want. We’ve got to get rid of common core, bring educational…

And folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA. And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That I can tell you.
Listen, you know these politicians, they don’t know me. They don’t understand me. And I am, I’m in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses. These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can’t support Donald Trump. The reason they can’t, you know why, because I’m not going to hire these people, I don’t want these people.
Take a look. Take a look at what these people — these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things — take a look what has happened in our country. Our military is depleted, our vets aren’t taken care of. We can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur — can you imagine — and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it.
I love. But can you imagine them seeing that we can’t beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can’t beat them? We’re fighting a political correct war.

It’s a political correct war. I mean, you know what’s going on. You know what’s going on. These are people that chop off heads. These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people.
These are people that buried people in the sand. We’ve got to knock them out.
I was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn’t have been to the war in Iraq. It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen. But we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we got out.
The way we got out was insane. And Obama gave a date, and he — and that’s how ISIS happened, folks. Hence, the birth of ISIS.
Congratulations, Hillary Clinton. Congratulate — I mean, she — she should get — if I’m ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award. OK?
And I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made. Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that’s the better alternative, all right? But he has been an incompetent president. He has done a horrible job.
And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again — and he would only say this to his wife — but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives.
And I mean lives on both sides. I’m not just saying — I mean lives on both sides. She’s inept; she’s inept.
And to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK? It always will be.
So — so, I want to thank all of you for being here. Look, I’m going to be around, and we’re going to be coming to North Carolina a lot. Got to win it, very important.
But — the people are great. My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina. I’m here all the time.
But — but people — the people are great. The military is great. We are going to make America great again.
We’re going to start winning. We’re going to put America first. We’re going to make America safe again.

But never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I’ll be back soon. Thank you. God bless you.
Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart.
Story Continued Below
I love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November.
Tonight is not going to be a normal rally speech.
Instead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration.
I have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico – a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country. Just like I am a man who loves the United States.
We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.
We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations.
It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation. This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries.
But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington. There is no other way.
The truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren’t known because the media won’t report on them, the politicians won’t talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.
Today you will get the truth.
The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn’t serve: it doesn’t serve you, the American people.
When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.
Immigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.
But if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues.
For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions. These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.
We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.
Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.
I have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders. They will be joining me on the stage later today.
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.
Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.
Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration’s priorities for removal.
In California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.
A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.
On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.
While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn’t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.
But these facts are never reported.
Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally.
The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants – or however many there may be.
That has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue.
Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.
Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don’t have legal status.
To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second.
Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she’s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death. No, she’s only talking about families who came here in violation of the law.
We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention – and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.
Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants – breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term.
Now that you’ve heard about Hillary Clinton’s plan – about which she has not answered a single substantive question – let me tell you about my plan.
While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations. I also worked with lawmakers who’ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I’ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies.
Number One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border.
On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall.
Number Two: End Catch-And-Release
Under my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.
Number Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.
According to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country. We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement.
Beyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice. But their days on the run will soon be over. They go out, and they go out fast.
Moving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. We will terminate the Obama Administration’s deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.
Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who not detained or processed for deportation.
My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens.
We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.
On my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass “Kate’s Law” – named for Kate Steinle – to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.
Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed.
We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.
The local police know who every one of these criminals are. There’s no great mystery to it, they’ve put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.
We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks. We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations.
I’ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. The endorsement I’ve received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say.
Number Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary Cities
We will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.
Number Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws
We will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.
Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs – including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.
Clinton’s plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office.
In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement – and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation – that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.
Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges – that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who’ve come here under the current Administration.
Number Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur
According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.
As soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.
Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.
For the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.
Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.
For instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan – in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.
Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure.
Number Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported
There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick’s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.
The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.
According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.
Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate.
Number Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.
For years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed.
In my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and “would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.”
Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration. If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave – the Obama-Clinton policy – then we have a completely open border. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.
Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.
We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.
Immigration law doesn’t exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life – the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.
I will enforce all of our immigration laws.
The same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury.
Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal.
Number 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers
We’ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.
Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration – as we have following previous immigration waves – to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility.
Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.
The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:
· To keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms
· To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We need a system that serves our needs – remember, it’s America First.
· To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency
· And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.
We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.
We’ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. We wouldn’t put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?
Let’s talk about the big picture
These ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years.
Because I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family.
We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities.
For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.
We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.


For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.
We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.
Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.
This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays.
People will know that you can’t just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. Those days are over.
In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.
Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time.
Whether it’s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing – and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton’s answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.
These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.
What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.
This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better.
This is it. We won’t get another opportunity – it will be too late.
So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for – and who we are fighting for.
So I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.
Now is the time for these voices to be heard.
Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.
Let’s fix this problem.
Let’s secure our border.

Thank you, and God Bless you all!
 Wow. Thank you. That’s a lot of people, Phoenix, that’s a lot of people.

Thank you very much.

Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.
The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.
Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also? So, I said let’s go and have some fun tonight. We’re going to Arizona, O.K.?

This will be a little bit different. This won’t be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I’m going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.
I’ve just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.

And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.
We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.
We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we’re all going to win. Both countries, we’re all going to win.

This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And in a Trump administration we’re going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it’s going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.
But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren’t known because the media won’t report on them. The politicians won’t talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That’s the way it is.

Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It’s all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.
Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn’t serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.
Thank you. But if we’re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it’s impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.

These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it’s just not going to work out. It’s our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.
Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.

Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.

This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.

He was released again after the crime, and now he’s out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.

Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open-border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.

He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.

Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.

Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.

In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.

A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.

On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.

While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn’t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.

And they’re hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.

But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they’re treated better than our vets.

Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.
The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be — and honestly we’ve been hearing that number for years. It’s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be three million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.

Frankly our government has no idea what they’re doing on many, many fronts, folks.
But whatever the number, that’s never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn’t matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.
Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America — you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don’t have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it’s not nuclear, and it’s not ISIS, it’s not Russia, it’s not China, it’s global warming.

To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.
Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she’s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.

No, she’s only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.

We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.
Thank you.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.

Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.
On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.
Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what’s going to happen, folks. It’s not going to be pretty.
This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?
Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you’ve heard about Hillary Clinton’s plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice...
And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn’t want to get into the quagmire. It’s a tough one, she doesn’t know what she’s doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.
While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.

I also worked with lawmakers, who’ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I’ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.

Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?
We will build a great wall along the southern border.
And Mexico will pay for the wall.
One hundred percent. They don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay for it. And they’re great people and great leaders but they’re going to pay for the wall.
On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.
We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that’s the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.
Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I’m sure they will.
Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.
Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.
And they’ll be brought great distances. We’re not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They’d drop them across, right across, and they’d come back. And across.

Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, O.K.?

Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it’s so great. It’s hard to believe, people don’t even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.
Zero. They don’t come in here. They don’t come in here.

According to federal data, there are at least two million, two million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, two million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.

Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect — say hello to the police. Boy, they don’t get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They’re great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.

They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can’t do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.
And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn’t like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They’re gone.

Beyond the two million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They’re going to be gone. It will be over.
They’re going out. They’re going out fast.

Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.

We will terminate the Obama administration’s deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.

That’s over. That’s over, folks. That’s over.

Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn’t have been politically correct.

My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don’t even know about.

Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.

This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There’s no common sense, there’s no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.

On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate’s Law, named for Kate Steinle...

... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.
And then we get them out.

Another reform I’m proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.

The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They’re going to go.

We’re going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.

Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, O.K.?
Maybe they’ll be able to deport her.
The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don’t have to be abused by these thugs anymore.

There’s no great mystery to it, they’ve put up with it for years, and now finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.

We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.
Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.

And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.

I’ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.
And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate.

Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.
We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.

We will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.

And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.

Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.

Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.

And don’t forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don’t forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don’t forget your Second Amendment. And don’t forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.

And don’t forget building up our depleted military. And don’t forget taking care of our vets. Don’t forget our vets. They have been forgotten.
Clinton’s plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.
Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.
Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don’t have a country.

Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who’ve come here under this current corrupt administration.
Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.

According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we’ve ever had in the history of our country.

Our country is a mess. We don’t even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.
The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.

Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.

I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It’s going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that’s fine but they’re going to be good. It’s extreme.

And if people don’t like it, we’ve got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. It’s going to end badly folks. It’s going to end very, very badly.

For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we’ll get the money from Gulf states. We don’t want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.

But we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We’ll supervise it. We’ll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.

Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.

Thank you. We’re very proud of our country. Aren’t we? Really? With all it’s going through, we’re very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That’s what they say.

That’s what they say. They’re justified. Right? And we’re admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.

Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.
There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won’t take them back. So we say, O.K., we’ll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.
Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.
And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick’s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries.

Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.

In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don’t.

The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.

According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.

We’re like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.

These 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.
And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I’m talking about.
Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.

The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.
Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.
For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.

Hillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it’s always the wrong decision. You ever notice?

In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.

Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody’s telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we’ll take care of you.

Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose — and they really are a big problem — pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas.

And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn’t that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant.

Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.
If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that’s what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.

We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.

Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.
We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.

Immigration law doesn’t exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.

That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.

And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.

Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.
Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We’re going to take care of our workers.

And by the way, and by the way, we’re going to make great trade deals. We’re going to renegotiate trade deals. We’re going to bring our jobs back home. We’re going to bring our jobs back home.

We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with Nafta. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.

We’re going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there’s going to be a lot of trouble for them. It’s not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They’re not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It’s not going to happen. There will be consequences.
We’ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.

We’ve had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.
Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.

To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.
We take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.

You know, folks, it’s called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it’s called America first. Remember that.
To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn’t that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.
And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She’s going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she’ll say, so long, see you in four years. That’s what it is.

She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She’s done nothing. She’s been there for 35 years. She’s done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we’re going to do together. Watch.
You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We’ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They’re decades and decades old.

To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They’re archaic. They’re ancient. We wouldn’t put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?

So let’s now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It’s going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I’ve spent a lot of money on my campaign, I’ll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.

I will get this done for you and for your family. We’ll do it right. You’ll be proud of our country again. We’ll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.

And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We’re going to rebuild them, for once and for all.

For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry —

Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system — and it will be an efficient system — will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.TRUMP: We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.

Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can’t do it.

(APPLAUSE)

This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can’t just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It’s not going to work that way. Those days are over.

(APPLAUSE)

Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.

(APPLAUSE)

And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.

That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.

(APPLAUSE)

Right now, however, we’re in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.

Whether it’s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton’s answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.

(APPLAUSE)

These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn’t answer.

She didn’t go to Louisiana. She didn’t go to Mexico. She was invited.

She doesn’t have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won’t like what you’re hearing.

The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That’s what’s going to happen, as sure as you’re standing there.

This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.

(APPLAUSE)

It’s our last chance. It’s our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that. So I want to remind everyone what we’re fighting for and who we are fighting for.

I am going to ask — these are really special people that I’ve gotten to know. I’m going to ask all of the “Angel Moms” to come join me on the stage right now.

These are amazing women.

(APPLAUSE)

These are amazing people.

(APPLAUSE)

These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I’ve gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they’re going through is incredible, and there’s just no reason for it. Let’s give them a really tremendous hand.

(APPLAUSE)

That’s tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.

So, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.

Let’s fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let’s our secure our border.

(APPLAUSE)

Let’s stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let’s protect our social security and Medicare. Let’s get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.

This has been an incredible evening. We’re going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.

We’re going to bring — thank you, thank you. We’re going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We’re going to take our country back.

Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven’t been looking to what’s been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.

(APPLAUSE)

Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we’re going to make America great again.

Thank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.

Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept
your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th
of last year we – and I say “we” because we are a team – would have
received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican
Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than
it received four years ago. The Democrats, on the other hand, received
almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got eight years ago. 
Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead
our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. 
We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a
country of law and order.
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on
our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any
politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of
violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. 
Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its
victims.
I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts
our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017,
safety will be restored.
The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.
It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the
media myths—the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the
American people with the truth, and nothing else.
These are the facts:
Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed 
by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.
Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities.
That’s the largest increase in 25 years.
In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.
They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.
In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have
been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been
killed in the Chicago area since he took office.
The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost
50% compared to this point last year.
Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported
from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.
The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border 
so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being
released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for
the impact on public safety or resources.
One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She
was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with
a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time,
and he is now a fugitive from the law.
I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing
daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One
more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.
What about our economy?
Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly
news and your morning newspaper:
Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% 
of African-American youth are not employed.
2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama
took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.
Household incomes are down more than 4 thousand dollars since the year
2000 – 16 years ago.
Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly 800 billion dollars last year alone.
The budget is no better.
President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than
trillion dollars, and growing.Americans are on food stamps.
Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived
through one international humiliation after another.
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by
their Iranian captors at gunpoint.
This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran
150 billion dollars and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of
the worst deals ever negotiated.
Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria –
and the whole world knew it meant nothing.
In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe
– was brought down in flames.
Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling
apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million 
America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when
Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s
foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.
Her bad instincts and her bad judgement – something pointed out by
Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding
today.
Let’s review the record.
In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt
was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being
choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.
After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?
ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.
Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die
at the hands of savage killers.
Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the
military to retake control.
Iraq is in chaos.
Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. 
Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the
West.
After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent
and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been
before. 
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and
weakness.
But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.
The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and
destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the
same politicians who created them.
A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.
Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.
The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents,
is that our plan will put America First.
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we
can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
This will all change when I take office.
The American People will come first once again.
My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods,
secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity
without law and order.
On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and
trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by
some of our nation’s most powerful special interests.
That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic
system for their exclusive benefit.
Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the
campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged
system in place.
They are throwing money at her because they have total control over
everything she does.
She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change.
My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right
now.
Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all
across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.
I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by
our horrible and unfair trade deals.
These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work
hard but no longer have a voice
I AM YOUR VOICE.
I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our
politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence,
no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.
When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or
the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has
sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the 
other way.
And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private
server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts
our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no
consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never
before.
When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely
careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know
that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were
just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes. 133
In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an
egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others, who
have done far less, have paid so dearly.
When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading
access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up
on people who cannot defend themselves.
Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I
have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like
it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. But his
supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue:
trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth. 
Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix
the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American.
In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the
United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to
Indiana.
He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the
job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from
the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.
America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so
brutally executed.
Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence
against our law enforcement officials.
Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.
On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Three were killed, and three were badly injured.
An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.
I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law
enforcement officials to get the job done.
In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the
presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more
dangerous environment for everyone.
This Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on
education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them
in every way and on every level.
When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated
equally, and protected equally.
Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young
Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have the same
right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?
To make life safe for all our citizens, we must also address the growing
threats we face from outside the country: we are going to defeat the
barbarians of ISIS.
Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women
and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.
The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has
been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party
in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in
Chattanooga, and many more.
Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were
savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted
our LGBTQ community.
As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ
citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.
We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world.
We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change
that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must
work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and
stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in
the region, the State of Israel.
Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly
cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying
their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost.
Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new
program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.
Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has
been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting
mechanisms have been put in place.
My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on
top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under
President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way
to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they
come from.
I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values
and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression
is not welcome in our country and never will be.
Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher
unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.
We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works
for the American people.
On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed
by illegal immigrants—Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel
Shaw.
They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have
suffered so gravely.
Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than
the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their
children to violence spilling across our border. 
These families have no special interests to represent them.
There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.
My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.
Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.
But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?
Where was the Sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so
brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?
These wounded American families have been alone.
But they are alone no longer.
Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support
them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save
countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.
We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop
the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our
communities.
I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border
Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our
lawful immigration system. 
By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human
smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will
be restored. 
By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.
Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security
have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen
very closely to the words am about to say.
On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will
finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are
enforced.
We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my
greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration
policy of Hillary Clinton. 
Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want
relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration,
and mass lawlessness.
Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your
jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from
poverty and join the middle class.
I have a different vision for our workers.
It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to
countries that cheat.
It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be
a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of
office.
I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to
make our country rich again. 
I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.
America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997,
following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and
Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst
economic deals ever made by our country. 
Never again.
I am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and New
York, and Michigan and to all of America – and I am not going to let
companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way,
without consequence.
My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade
agreement that has been destroying our middle class.
She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.
She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which will not only
destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of
foreign governments.
I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that
diminishes our freedom and independence.
Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer
will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are
thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads
or understands.
We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats.
This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property,
along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. 
Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally
renegotiated.
That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America –
and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want.
Our country is going to start building and making things again.
Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.
While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the
largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year –
Democrat or Republican.
Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief,
and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.
America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes
will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our
country.
Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest
job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as 2 trillion dollars a year, and we will end it.
We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
This will produce more than 20 trillion dollars in job-creating economic
activity over the next four decades.
My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel
workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am
President.
With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into
our country. 
This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans.
We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the
railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.
We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them
to a safe school of their choice.
My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American
children.
We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. 
And we will fix TSA at the airports!
We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to
take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.
We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we
are protecting, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.
We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken
care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous
veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be
able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice. My opponent dismissed
the VA scandal – one more sign of how out of touch she really is.
We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list
of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Courtwho will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar
views, principles, and judicial philosophy. This will be one of the most
important issues decided by this election.
My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the
other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle
Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families
safe. 
At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious
community in general who have been so good to me and so supportive.
You have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from
speaking your minds from your own pulpits. 
An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens
religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly
advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that
language and protect free speech for all Americans. 
We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to
do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.
It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better
and stronger than ever before.
In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my
wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always
be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever
knew.
I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.
It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the
dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most
comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and
I have a lot of that in me also.
Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fairminded.
She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most
honest and charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of
character.
To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late
brother Fred, I will always give you my love—you are most special to me.
I have had a truly great life in business.
But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to
go to work for you.
It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people.
But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.
America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by
a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country
you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here
tonight.
No longer can we rely on those same people in the media, and politics,
who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.
Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.
History is watching us now. It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and
independent and strong.
I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the
White House.
My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It
reads: “I’m With Her”.
I choose to recite a different pledge.
My pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”
I am your voice.
So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams
for their future, I say these words to you tonight:
I’m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make
this promise:
We Will Make America Strong Again.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again.
And We Will Make America Great Again.
God bless You And Good Night.
Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.

We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.

I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America’s core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.

We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.

I’m proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win – and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.

In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.

Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.

We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.

Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.

This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare – as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.

Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world – just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.

We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.

At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.

We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.

These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.

Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton’s legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.

Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton’s policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.

Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.

Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn’t a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn’t want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.

Hillary Clinton is just reckless – so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton’s team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.

In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn’t recall important information on 39 occasions.

She can’t even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn’t even know the letter “C” means confidential.

If she can’t remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.

Her conduct is simply disqualifying.

She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton’s only foreign policy experience is “failure.” Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.

Let’s look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.

Libya was stable.

Syria was under control.

Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.

Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.

Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.

Fast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?

Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.

Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.

In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.

Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.

ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.

Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States – plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.

Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.

This is Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy legacy.

But that’s not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.

History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.

Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.

When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.

The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.

Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.

In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it’s just 182,000.

Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops—which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.

It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.

In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.

In the current year, we are spending $548 billion – a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts – even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.

As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.

This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.

As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.

I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks – and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.

Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.

We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.

We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.

The military will not be exempt either – the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.

Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.

Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.

Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a "short-run" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.

Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:

We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army’s chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.

We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now.

We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now.

And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1,113 now.

We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.

Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.

We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.

We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.

As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.

Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.

In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense’s cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.

Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.

Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.

We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.

One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.

These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.

America must be the world’s dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs.

We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.

Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.

To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.

We will protect those who protect us.

And we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.

Together, we will have one great American future.

We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.

America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.

We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.

We Will Bring Back Our Jobs.

We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.
Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands. So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this. And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time. When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically. The US has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people. It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken. So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19, and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said, and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, Don't hit Iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league. We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love, they're great, all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers. And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it. Last week, I read 2300 Humvees, these are big vehicles, were left behind for the enemy. 2000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them. Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product, a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero. Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate. And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5. Don't believe it. That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs. But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense. Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare. Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster. And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website. I have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website. Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us, believe me, to the promised land. They will not. As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know, Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it? I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us. But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches. I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job. And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in 2016, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to, I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now. We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be, and, and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully, they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully. Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now. Now, our country needs, our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal. We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. And we also need a cheerleader. You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit. He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader. He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that. But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite. We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. We need, we need somebody, we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough. You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again. So ladies and gentlemen. I am officially running. for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be, they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money. Right now, think of this: We owe China $1 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better. How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? I'm going to tell you, thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons. Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator. He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have. Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But. So we need people, I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work. So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again. But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything, everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete. So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, What's your problem? He said, You know, I make great product. And I said, I know. I know that because I buy the product. He said, I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it. I said, Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this? He said, Yeah, they do it all the time with other people. I said, They send it back? Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them. Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there. Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing. Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for, I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable. I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, Oh, you don't like China? No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much, it's like, it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders. They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place. We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly. Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country, we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port. They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China. And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico. So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it. But I have another one, Ford. So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people. All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good. Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company. So I announced that I'm running for president. I would.. one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in, and I wouldn't even use, you know, I have, I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they're not good. But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well. But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border. And you say to yourself, How does that help us, right? How does that help us? Where is that good? It's not. So I would say, Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it. Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford. And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us. So under President Trump, here's what would happen: The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool. And he'll say, Please, please, please. He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, No interest. Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, Sorry, fellas. No interest, because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I. And by the way, I'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country. So, because we got to make the country rich. It sounds crass. Somebody said, Oh, that's crass. It's not crass. We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems. We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete. We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. But here's what's going to happen: After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the, the donors and by the lobbyists, and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero, I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. Please reconsider, I'll say no. He'll say, Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico. That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice. There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example. Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say we're gonna protect. What are we doing? They've got nothing but money. If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us. And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out, and they kept our equipment. They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be, we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff. But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone. And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now, it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, Is he intelligent? Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question. How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna, how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible. But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders. There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people. So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence. Somebody said, thank you, darlin'. Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? Great. Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. So the reporter said to me the other day, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you? I said, I don't know. I said, I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person. But, I said, This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle. They're right about that, but I'm doing it. Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth. So I said, That's OK. I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. I started off, thank you, I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said, and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot. But he used to say, Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it. I said, I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it. And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals, the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing. But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks. So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. I've employed, I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything. So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't use extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion. So I said, No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets. So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate. It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world. And I have assets, big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected, 9 billion 240 million dollars. And I have liabilities of about $500 million. That's long term debt, very low interest rates. In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion? I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it. But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of net worth, not assets, not, a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets, Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York, many other places all over the world. So the total is $873754000. Now I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not. I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking. We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years, you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion. According to the economists, who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying, that $24 trillion, we're very close, that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon. So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare. I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find, within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around. I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened, it's up in the prison area, my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting. I said, Very interesting. So protect the Second Amendment. End, end Common Core. Common Core should, it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end education has to be local. Rebuild the country's infrastructure. Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought. I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad. You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, DC We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after, or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it. Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built. So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40 year old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw. You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost. Renegotiate our foreign trade deals. Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful. And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important. Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. That's so nice. Isn't he a great guy. He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it. It's just not fair. And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party. Also, also the people of Iowa. They have something in common. Hard working people. They want to work, they want to make the country great. I love the people of Iowa. So that's the way it is. Very simple. With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job. The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused. Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible. In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray. Very simple. Politicians are all talk, no action. They are all talk and no action. And it's constant; it never ends. And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican. And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians. Because they let the president get away with absolute murder. You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to,. Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens. You look at Obamacare. A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in 2016 and it is going to be a disaster. People are closing up shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy. He said, I have more accountants than I have patients. And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business. And he was very successful guy. But it's happening more and more. Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website. I have many websites, many, many websites. They're all over the place. But for $10, okay? Now everything about Obamacare was a lie. It was a filthy lie. And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted? Does anyone do anything? And what are the Republican politicians doing about it? He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect. You can keep your plan. And you've all heard that hundreds of times. That's like the real estate location, location. I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location. But you have heard this about Obamacare. And it's disgraceful. It's a big, fat, horrible lie. Your deductibles are going through the roof. You're not going to get, unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage. And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore. So it's a real, real disaster. And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare. And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it. Now, we have to build a fence. And it's got to be a beauty. Who can build better than Trump? I build; it's what I do. I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings. Fences are easy, believe me. I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border. They're walking. The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country. It is so terrible. It is so unfair. It is so incompetent. And we don't have the best coming in. We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks. You can certainly have terrorists. You can certainly have Islamic terrorists. You can have anything coming across the border. We don't do anything about it. So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border. Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it. Benghazi. Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi. Everything is Benghazi. What happens? Nothing. IRS, e mails. I get sued all the time, okay. I run a big business. You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful. I have done so many deals. Almost all of them have been tremendously successful. You'll see that when I file my statements. I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay. But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president. Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many, Look, Obama, what did he do? No deal. He never did a deal. He did one deal. A house. And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay. He got away with murder. But I can tell you, e mails. IRS, the e mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost. If you were in my world you would know that e mails can't be lost; they can't be lost. So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e mails are? They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it. Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great. But they talk about it. And then you have a president that does an executive order. Nobody even heard of an executive order. He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders. Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment, which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that, why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier. Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it. We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed. So we have to do something. Jobs. China. I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese. One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it. And I know them. And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with. We can't believe how stupid your leaders are. They tell me that. Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not. But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much, goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries. The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation. I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing. They are devaluing down to nothing. And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete. And they're getting away with it. And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it. But you watch this devaluation of all of it. I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing. And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good. You know it's one of those things, sounds good. Be very careful. Be very careful. Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing. They have it set. Don't forget another thing. China became the number one economic power a year ago. That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen. It was absolutely unthinkable. So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq. We got nothing. They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us. Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us. We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS. By the way, you know how they formed. They took the oil. And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump, there are some of you, have I been saying for four years, keep the oil. So now ISIS has the oil. And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take. So we get nothing. We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have. I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people. And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military. But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast. We have incompetent people. They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing. It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security. because I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security. I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid. Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security. And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue. It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things. Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons. We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast. We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We can't do it. Can't do it. We cannot let that happen. You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria. We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria. Think of this. We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government. Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay. But think of it; think of it. ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall. There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear. Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles. You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable. The power. And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens. We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there. We're trying to do the right thing. We have leadership, again, no leadership respects us. You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find. The same thing is happening there. And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals. And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals. They're taking it out. Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals. So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker. It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country. If we don't, The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed. Bridges are collapsing all over the country. The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai. I go to various different places. I go to China. They are building a bridge on every corner. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff. They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen. They are building airports in Qatar, which they like to say cutter but I've always said Qatar so I'll keep it Qatar what the hell. But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen. And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes. The place is falling apart. You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart. And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt. So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place. This is inside, not outside. And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen. In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor. I said it's not an honor; they're just smart. But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad, I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails. You know the guard rails. The ones that sort of go like this that are always bent, rusted and horrible. Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes. Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years. Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works. Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening. Somebody made a lot of money on that. They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again. We have to rebuild our country. And we have a long way to go. We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money. Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it. We owe it to other countries. They're the ones that hold the debt. And then we give them money. We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies. I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know, No American company comes to see and comes to bid. It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them. What are we doing; why aren't they paying us? Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing? I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea. You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea. Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on? Now, we have a very important election coming up. We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people. Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details. We have some good people. It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed. He failed. I mean I liked him. Look, like him, dislike him, the 47 percent statement that he made, that's not going away. The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away. What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time. It's not fair because it was a long t, That doesn't work. But more importantly, he choked. Something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won. And let me tell you something. That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal. I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it. Or a golfer that can't sink the three footer to win the tournament. And there are many of them. Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that. You can't give somebody another chance, because actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president. I really do. I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true. So you can't have Romney. He choked. You can't have Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing, You know they copied it. I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing. But I said it. I was the one that said it first, and I mean it. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that. But he's totally in favor of Common Core. He's very, very weak on immigration. Don't forget, remember his statement, they come for love. I say, what? Come for love? You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals. They're coming for love? They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love. And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama. I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama. because Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months. And then he appointed Justice Roberts. And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts. And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes. So you can't have Jeb Bush. And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win. So Mitt and, you just can't have those two. That's it. That's it. It's so simple. So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important. And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters. And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet. He is reading it. I mean give me a break. Everything is read. You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk. And that's what we ended up getting, the king of teleprompters. But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing. No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that. But we have to do something about these teleprompters. But in looking at these situations, I built an incredible company. And you'll see that. An incredible company; a wonderful company. I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing. And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix. We have such great potential. So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in: creating jobs; defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists, and you have to do that; reducing the budget deficit, so important, have to do it; securing our Southern border, and I mean seriously securing it; stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere; saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it; repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country. And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody. And everybody can be covered. I'm not saying leave 50 percent of the people out. Everybody can be c, This plan is just a basic disaster. Nobody knows. As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is; fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports. And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump. I just got the best hotel in North America. I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one. I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress. Right on Penn., The Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama. Do you believe that? And everybody wanted it. So, I can't believe it myself. But it's going to be fantastic; and so many other things. I know what needs to be done to make America great again. We can make this country great again. The potential is enormous. And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you. We have so many problems in this country. We'll talk about a few of them. And we'll celebrate because ultimately, we're going to have victory. We're going to have victory. This is a movement that's happening. I had a lawyer come up to see me a little while ago that said Mr. Trump, I've been doing this for 35 years and never seen what happened here. I got a call from a writer from The New York Times. I have great respect for The New York Times. And called up, I know. I hear that. OK. It's a good story, not a bad story. And he said could I ask you a question? I said what? Very powerful writer, actually. He said how does it feel? How does what feel? He said what you've done has never ever been done before. You've dominated. You have taken over the polls. You know, on television, on FOX and CNN, they call it all Trump all the time. Can you believe it? All trump all the time. And by the way, their ratings are through the roof. If they weren't, they wouldn't put me on. I'll be honest. It's a simple formula in entertainment and television. If you get good ratings, if you get good ratings and these aren't good, these are monster, then you're going to be in all the time even if you have nothing to say. If you come up with a cure for a major, major, horrendous disease and if you don't get ratings, they don't bother even reporting it. It's very simple business. It's very simple. So we've gone on, we've had a lot of fun and now it's time to really start because this is going to happen, I'm telling you, I'm not going anymore. Somebody said today. We're not going anywhere. We are not going anywhere. Somebody said today you've done so well, you don't have to go any further. I said are you crazy? You know what? The writer the Times told me, he said it's been amazing what you've done. I said but I haven't won. We haven't won anything. What if I won? I'm having fun and all, but I haven't won. There's been no victory. He said it doesn't matter. What you've done is incredible. You have won. I said you're wrong, unless I win it's been a waste of time for me, I'll be honest. A total waste of time. I really mean that, too. We should have won, thank you, he said you will win. We should have won last time. Mitt Romney let us down. I mean, he let us down. He let us down. You know, one of the things that I'm really happy about, I'm surging, they said. Can you believe this one? I'm surging with women. Can you believe it? I have such respect for women. I cherish women. I'm going to take such good care of women's health care issues, you won't even believe it, but I'm surging with women. One of the things coming out, I'm watching television and they said Trump is surging with women. I said really? That's amazing. You know, it's incredible. I'll make like statements because, you know, Carly is giving me a little bit of a hard time even though her poll numbers are horrible. She's the one. She was another one. She is surging. Ben is, everybody is surging but me. Hilary is not surging, I tell you that. They are not saying, thank you. Hilary is not surging. Look, I like Carly and I like Ben and I like many of the people that I'm running against. I mean, many of these people are terrific people, but nobody is going to be able to do the job that I'm going to do. Nobody. They won't. They won't. Don't forget, I love these people in back of me. But they won't. I mean, what I do is I do deals. I deal. I have tremendous energy, tremendous to a point where it's almost ridiculous when you think about it. But we need somebody with great energy, with great passion, with great deal making skills. And we need a closer. We need closers. We don't have closers. We just don't have closers. And honestly, they are not deal people. I'll tell you they are good at raising money for their packs or whatever they holding. Probably, they are not supposed to do that but most of them are doing anyway. It's illegal as hell, but I think they are doing it anyway. You notice they have money in the pack but they don't have hard money, but the pack has given them, I say what is going on over here? How come I can't talk to anybody? And again, I have to tell you this, and I want to have your opinion. So I'm self funding I told you. But if I took hundreds of millions, I tell you what, I could have $200 million so fast. If I took that, would you people object if I promise not to do anything from the people I took it from? No? I had a group in Iowa, actually, they were much more vocal about this one issue. And they stood up, no, no, the place, I mean, I realize how important it is, putting your own money in because I'm telling people that Jeb, nice guy, really a nice guy. Jeb is more popular than one person I know. But all of them. I don't want to go through the names. They have money put up in packs or hard money, wherever the money is, believe me, I was the king. I was the king. You know, I was the white haired, no, blonde haired, let's say blonde. But, I was the blonde head. I was perfect. I was the ultimate. I was the ultimate sort of insider. I put up money. They loved me. But then when I said I'm running, they all looked at me like the RNC, Reince is a great guy but it took him a little while because they looked at me like you're not supposed to be doing that. You're supposed to be putting up money. And if you need something in two years, three years, five years, they will do whatever you want. And what happened is I know the system I think better than anybody. I know the tax system. Look, taxes. Who knows better than me? We're going to reduce taxes. We're going to make the hedge fund, any hedge fund guys it would be mostly, you got good seats. Are there any hedge fund guys in this room? If there are, you should probably leave right now. But I have a friend in the hedge fund business, not really a friend. Not actually a nice guy, but it be goof representing us, I will tell you. Because by the time I finish he might not have much of a hedge fund. But I said what did you make last year? He said about $250 million. This is serious. I said, oh, that's a lot of money. What did you pay in taxes? He goes, Don, practically nothing. That was a couple years ago. I never forgot it. The other day he calls me up because he heard me talk about hedge fund guys are going to pay up. And he call up the other day. I was only kidding, you know, when I said that or sort of it. He doesn't know what to do. The truth is they will do just fine. They will do just fine because we'll make the country so successful, they will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. But we got to lower taxes for a lot of people. Corporations paying far too much, far too much, middle income people are being decimated, they are being decimated. I mean, we have a group of 200 guys but the middle income in this country is being decimated and we're going to change it. We're going to change it. So I'll be announcing over the next three or so weeks, I'll be announcing, I think a great tax plan. I know the tax code. I know everything about it, probably as well as anybody, there is, right? And we are going to be doing something that's going to be really pro, growth, really reduction in taxes. We're going to get the $2 trillion that's in other countries, we're going to get it back. No, we're going to get it back. And you know, you have corporate inversion. Does anybody know what that means? You know, in the old days people might leave New York for Texas or they may go from New Jersey to Florida or whatever. It's not that way anymore. Now they go from this country to other countries, and they go for two reasons, lower taxes, lower labor, but lower taxes. You have countries that want to charge them nothing. So they take these companies and these guys, they make a fortune, they have no real loyalty in many cases. They have no real loyalty to the United States. They want to show good profit and loss. So they take and go to another country. And all of a sudden their numbers look good. And they can't bring their money back in. And by the way for two and a half, three years, I have seen every politician agrees we should lower the tax on bringing money because it's so onerous that nobody in this room would bring that money back. Everybody says it for two and a half years, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody, they can't make a deal. They can't make a deal. We have a government that's really messed up because we don't have a leader at the top. A right leader could get it done. The right leader will get it done and you will see numbers like you've never seen before. I actually believe that and we're in trouble. You know, I've made the statement and I've said this before, the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. I made that statement. And I'll tell you what happens and it happens a lot. The other day I went home and I said to my wife, what's wrong? Oh, darling, you were very tough. What? What did I do? Of course, it's live television. She said you said the American dream is dead. I said no, I said the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. She said no, you didn't. You just said it's dead. So I turn on television, it's wonderful to record this and see it ten hours later. I turn on television and me standing in this big crowd, the American dream is dead. I said, oh. Again, the dishonest media. I went ballistic. I was so angry. But the American dream is going to be better. I tell you what? We can make it better than ever before. We can do, I mean, we're in Texas. We can do things with oil and gas that will be unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Try sending your oil outside of the boundaries of the United States. How ridiculous. And we're sitting on top because of technology, we can be the number one energy producer in the world right here in the United States. But we have our laws, we have everything is wrong. And I have so many friends in the energy business, they are great people, they are working, they are not as rich as they were about two months ago, but these are minor details. They will be fine. But we can do things with energy that will be so, so incredible, which is great for Texas but great for the country. It's great for the country. Now, China, Japan, true, you can't be upset with China or Japan or Mexico. Can't be upset with anyone. You know, when I announced for the presidency, it was very interesting what happened. I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went to. And then they lied. They made it up. I'm talking about illegal immigration. And I brought up a subject called illegal immigration. And I just saw back stage some of the families who were decimated. Their families were decimated, their sons, their daughters killed by illegal immigrants and it's a massive problem. We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. We have to do it. Have to do it. And when I hear some of the people that I'm running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. And a wall works. All you have to do is go to Israel and say how is your wall working? Walls work. And I want people to come into the country but I want them to be legal and go through the process. I want them to come in. I want to have a big beautiful door but they have to be legal. They have to be. And if they are not going to be, they can't come in. And I'll tell you what, the first thing we do, you know, people realize, you look at crime in Chicago, you look at crime in so many different places and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They are rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast, And I think a lot of these countries send them in here because they don't want them. What do they want them in prison for 40 years? Look, look, whether it's any country, their leaders are smarter than our leaders. They are more cunning. They are tougher. They are better. And we take them, Kate in San Francisco, this magnificent young woman shot in the back by a guy sent over here probably pushed over, who knows, but he was an illegal immigrant came over, went to San Francisco. We have to end this sanction wary cities crap fast, fast. So he admits he's guilty. Now he's got a lawyer. Oh, he didn't really know. He wasn't aiming there. It was a ricochet, blah, blah, blah. It's disgusting what's happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are a dumping ground. And let me tell you something, the whole subject of anchor babies, did you hear that character from one of the networks? Anchor babies, just really not a nice term. I said what would you do, what would you say? And it gives me like a 12 word definition. I said no, we'll have to use anchor baby. But I don't mean to be disrespectful, but when a man has a problem and he's got his wife or his girlfriend and they move her over to the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border, our side, now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives, hopefully a long, it's wrong. It's wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn't call that. That's not what the law says and people are finding out now that I'm right. We didn't say that somebody can be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have a baby and now it's ours and we have to take care of the baby forever. It doesn't say that. It does not say it. So we have to straighten out, we have to straighten out our act. We're going to have a great country. We're going to have a great border. We're going to have a border that's a real border. You people are suffering. I'm in New York but from New York, too. They are all over the place. We want people to be in our country legally. Legally. And we want great people, too. We want people of achievement. If you go to Harvard or Stanford or the Wharton school of finance or any of these schools or Yale and you're the top in your close, you graduate and want to stay in the United States and have your career here, you can't. They throw you out. They put you back in China, they send you back to Mexico. They said those are the people, we need those people. We need them in Silicon Valley. We need in Manhattan. We need them in Dallas. We need them. Why are we throwing them out? They want to be in this country and we throw them out. So we have so many things we can do. So many things we can do. Now I'll give you the little thing that happened the other day. Made a speech on behalf of the tea party. And by the way, the tea party people are fantastic people. They are fantastic people. They love the country so much and you talk about people that get decimated, they just get decimated by the media. These are fantastic people. They love this country. These are the people that we want. But I look at what's going on and I look at what's happening and I made a speech in Washington the other day for the tea party and your senator, too, Senator Cruz who happens to be a good guy. Good guy. Now if he comes out and attacks me on Wednesday night, I will take it back immediately. OK? But he is a good guy. So I'm standing there and the capital building has a massive scaffolding around it, right? Have you seen it? Massive. I said man that's a big deal. As a real estate guy, the thing I do best is build. Hey, wouldn't it be good to have the president that knows how to build? Like I'm so good at it. Infrastructures, roads, airports, highways, I could do it for a fraction. You know, I'm building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue under budget ahead schedule, can you believe that? And I got it from the Obama administration and everyone else wanted it, which I still haven't figured out but it's going to be a great hotel. But they are doing the capital building and it has got massive, massive scaffolding. And we are having in 2016, you know, we're going to have a thing called like an election and they say that this massive scaffolding. I heard this the other day from a construction firm that this massive scaffolding, they want to have it for the inauguration, wouldn't that be nice for me? But they want to have all the scaffolding down but they can't do the work because they don't have enough time. They have so much time. What are they doing, caulking, pointing, fixing, structure, what the hell are they doing? It is not a big deal. So they are going to take all of the scaffolding down, paying millions to do that, millions and then after the inauguration, they are going to put it back up again and pay millions of dollars. Do you believe that? Right? Now I say do it simpler, get them to work faster. Do you agree? I like the idea. No, no. I like the idea of the scaffolding being down when they are swearing me in, I do. I don't want to see all the scaffolding all over the place. I want to see that beautiful, I want to see it. I love it. Such a beautiful building. But you know what? I told them, I said why don't you just move faster? Work faster. Get it done. So you take it down and you don't have to put it up. They said we never thought of that. Believe it? But they are going to take it down. They are going to take it down. So they are going to take it down and put it back up. Can you believe this? So let me tell you. I'm going to save my first money for the United States. If I win, I will let the scaffolding stay up, OK? All right? I'll let it stay up. We'll save millions of dollars. So in the pictures, they will have some scaffolding. They can probably no a days do something with that. So in the pictures we'll have scaffolding. So not if I win, stand up, what did you say? Not if you win, when you win. So a story I tell is a friend of mine who is a big manufacturer, great guy. Can't do business with China. Can't get his stuff in there. He calls me, he's depressed. He says to me, Donald, I can't deal with China and he's a good guy, does great stuff, better than they do. I can't sell it. They don't take it. Finally take it and charge a massive tax. A massive tax. Another friend of mine recently, he bought an airplane, a rich guy. Bought like for these people here. They probably all have, but a really good plane. Our country is being drained. Our jobs are being stolen by all these countries, not just them all of them. What would president Trump do? President trump? Trump, trump, trump. What would president Trump do? So I'd call the head of Ford or whatever company. But I'd call the head of Ford. I'd say congratulations. I understand you're building a massive plant in Mexico and you're taking a lot of jobs away from us in Michigan and other places. I don't like that. I don't like it. I just don't like it. And he will say, well, Mr. President, it's wonderful, wonderful for the economy. It's great. It's wonderful. Whose economy? Not for our economy. We lose on everything. We lose on jobs. We lose on money. We lose on everything. So what I'd say is the following, I don't want you to do that. And if you do it, you're not going to have any cars coming across the border unless you pay 35 percent tax. That's it. No, that's it. And they are going to say, they are going to say to me, Mr. President, please, please, please. Now, I guarantee you, let's say I make this call at 9:00 in the morning. By 5:00 in the afternoon I think the deal is done, they move back to the United States. It may take a half a day longer. May be 12:00 the following day, but I guarantee you, so they will, what will happen is I'll be called by lobbyists but not giving me money. I won't take it. So I turned down $5 million last week, $5 million. So I said I can't take it. You know, I go like this. I just close my eyes. You know, it's really sort of not natural to me to turn down money. Does that make, but I turn it down because once I know the game. Once they give you, you sort of owe them, right? You know. How can you tell a guy, you know, you gave me $5 million and helped me get elected and I'm going to hurt you with client. So, what happens, I would say, is that I will get a call from the head of Ford, and he'll say Mr. Trump, you're doing the wrong thing. I'd say, no, no, that's fine. Just do it. Just do what I say. Do what I say. And I guarantee you after I tell all the lobbyists, special interest and people that donate to everybody else but me because I won't take their money, after I tell them all no within a short period of time they will call up and they'll say, Mr. President we decided to move our plant back to the United States, sir. This is going to happen. That's what is going to happen. So, just a couple of more points and you know, it's depressing, isn't it depressing? You know, we're together, we love each other, but it's like depressing if you think about it. Because it doesn't end. I could stand up here all night long, I could tell you stories, they are all depressing. But the good news is, they can all be remedied. Every one of them. They can be remedied. So, Iran deal, Iran deal. They did not read that great book, where is that book? The Art of the Deal. They did not read it. Secretary of State Kerry, he actually may go down as worst than , because he made this deal. He may be the worst. He may top her because this deal is the all time worst. We're giving them 1, think of this, we're actually giving them $150 billion. Now think of it. Think of it. We don't have the right to inspect. We have to wait 24 days but before the clock starts ticking, we have to go through this whole process. I mean they could build their nuclear whatever, distribute and then have plenty of time leftover to clean the place up. So, you have a 24 day period, not anytime, anywhere, which is what it should be. Think of another thing. They have one instance where in a very major area, they self inspect. Now, can you believe this? They do their own inspections. They do their own inspections. And another thing, look, having a good deal, we should have doubled the sanctions, let , wait for another month or two. They would have come and we would have a deal like you've ever seen. We have our chief negotiators, Secretary Kerry at 73 years old goes into a bicycle race. Think of it. He's wearing the whole gear of helmet, he's like , he thinks he's in a bicycle race. He's actually in a race. It wasn't just casual, I could understand that. This is a guy that's in a bicycle race. 73 years old, all the gear, falls, breaks his leg in the middle of our thing. Takes two weeks off, goes back with crutches. The people from Iran say, what a shmuck. Can you believe this? But this is who we negotiate with. Now, think of this, it's embarrassing. Isn't it like embarrassing? How do you , I swear to you if I'm elected as president, I will never go into a bicycle race, I swear. So, but you know, one of the things. But I know the toughest guys in the world. Toughest smartest , I know people that are great. I know people that are overrated, won't use them. I know people that you never heard of better than all of them. I know the toughest guys and the smartest guys in the world. Carl Icahn called me. Carl Icahn is a great guy, very successful. If I put Carl Icahn in charge of trade with China, believe me, believe me, we do great. And, you know, believe me, instead of the people that we have that are political hacks, you know who is negotiating for us? Political hacks, political hacks. I asked for some numbers today before I came here. I said what's the United States trade deficit with China, Japan, and Mexico? Now, listen to these numbers. With China last year, we had a trade deficit of $343 billion. $343 billion. That's gone on for many years. A business that's no good. What do you do, you close it up, you start all over? You forget it. $343 billion. With Japan we're doing much better. It's only $67 billion. I call it that we're losing. Okay? Trade deficit. $67 billion. They send us so much, we send them practically nothing. Now, here is the beauty, Mexico. So Mexico, again, I love the people of Mexico. I respect the leaders. But they are too sharp. They are too good. So everyone said they won't build a wall because I said I'm going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it, right? Right? And all of these weak politicians, they are weak people. They are weak, weak people. They won't pay for it. I watch it on television. The idiots like Karl Rove. He said Mexico is going to pay for the wall. George Will, Mexico won't pay. Okay, think of this. First of all, there is going to be a wall. This isn't one of those deals where they jump over it, they go to Home Depot, buy a ladder, jump over the wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a real wall. You know, you know, the Great Wall of China is 13000 miles. It was built 2000 years ago. It was actually built over a long period of time, but it started 2000 , it's a long time. So 13000 miles. What we're talking about is 2000 miles, but less, maybe 1000 because you'll have a lot of territory where you don't need it. You have natural barricades, you have some walls that were built that are OK. Although, I'd like to be nice in uniform. You know, if I ever put my name on it, I want a gorgeous wall. You know. The Trump wall, that would be a beautiful wall. That's why I have to make it beautiful because some day when I'm gone, they are going to name that wall after Trump, I think. But I listened to these guys, and they say, how stupid , I listened to them today. Some politicians said Trump will never be able to afford the wall. We can't afford it. It's too expensive. It's peanuts. It's peanuts. It's nothing. And Mexico is going to pay. Now, here is the Mexico number, right? Let's say the wall cost $4 billion. You know, they say $10 billion. That means $4 billion if you know what you're doing and the $4 billion will be much bigger, much better, much stronger than the $10 billion. Believe me. Oh, do I know how to build? Greatest. One of the greats. So, let's say it costs $4 or $5 billion. Our trade deficit with Mexico is $53 billion. So four or five billion is peanuts. It's peanuts. Mexico is going to pay and they will be happy. They will be happy. Now, look, if you have some dumb politician negotiating, I agree they won't pay, but when you have Trump negotiating for you on your behalf, they will pay. 100 percent. 100 percent. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, Hey, boss, uh, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge. No, they never said that, they're talking about the weather? Right? So he knew about it, he knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's got a very friendly group of people over there.. Look, it's called life, you gotta be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be, but I doubt it. He knew about it. They mentioned it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like every day or every other day. They didn't say, 'Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor of a certain area is against you' Oh, OK, they didn't mention it. Nobody believes it. No. 2: Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades, it's a disaster, their property over there. The taxes are through, I'll use an expression: coming out of my ears, OK? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, Let me ask you, is he going to vote for Obama?' I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know, I thought he possibly did. Romney? I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed is he called Christie and they had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I woulda never done it. And he knows it is wrong. He is going to say, no, no, no, we don't want that, Ford. We don't want you to go. We are going to charge you of tax because, you know, the way you do it, you charge a tax. And then he is going to be hit by his lobbyists. They give him millions. He has $135, $140 million. I don't want anything. I don't want money. I'm just taking little small contributions for people. The woman said $7. And I was so, with a beautiful letter. It's amazing. I like that because that's like an investment. That adds up to the fuel for the plane for a trip to Iowa, OK? It all does, but who cares? I don't want that because I don't want to be controlled. Last week, you heard me say this. I turned down $5 million by a big lobbyist. Not a bad person. You know, a tough guy. Not a bad person. But when he gives me $5, he's not doing that because he thinks I have beautiful hair. It's not that bad. And it is my hair. Is it my hair? It is. It is actually. People don't know that. I proved that, you know, in Alabama. It was really hot. It was rainy. I took off my hat and everybody said it is really his hair. It's weird. I don't have to do that tonight. Sort of nice. But you know, so we would go over and the lobbyists would say, no, no, we gave you millions of dollars, Mr. President. And you owe it to Ford. Let. You have the lobbyists. You have. And after about ten minutes he is going to say I can't really do that. They really helped me in my campaign. With me, they're going to call me because I know all these guys. But they never did anything because I don't want money. I turned the money down. I turned down so much money. I feel like such a stupid person. No, it's true. First time in my life I feel stupid. Guys are giving me, offering me millions. Don, I would like to give you million. Wait, I'm telling you, $5 million. I could have it right now and I turn them down. I go back and say, do you think I'm doing the right thing? How about , I will just take a vote. How about if I take all these money and promise, I swear to you, that I won't do anything for these people. What about that? No? That's what I thought. I feel so stupid. But you know what? That's the way it has to be. Because I think one of the things they like about me is they don't, nobody is going to buy me. Nobody is going to buy me. All right. So after about ten minutes, Bush goes out and he says, all right, you can build your plant. Build it. I'm sorry. Please, I dare me. I mean, it was so terrible that I even thought about doing that, you know, because you contributed money. OK. Me, different. I'll call him up and say I have to go. I don't want you in Mexico. I love Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I have thousands have Mexican people that have worked for me over the years and even to this day. I mean, I love the Hispanics. The spirit. I love them. They are incredible people. But we have leaders that can't compete with their leaders. Their leaders are too smart. So I would say to the head of Ford, sorry. You will pay tax. Every car and every truck and every part that comes across that southern border, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax. OK? That's what's going to happen. And this is too easy. I don't need any of the killers. I'm going to use them anyway. But this is too easy. This is like forget it. This is taking candy from that beautiful little baby, OK. So easy. So what happens is they're going to say, no, no, no, and they're going to have people call me. But these are people that I didn't take any money, I didn't take anything. I don't want their money. So they are going to have people call me. And I'm going to say get out of here. And if I know them, they'll be friends of mine, maybe. I'll say I'm not interested. And I would say, let's say this whole process starts at 12:00 noon. I would say by 4:00 in the afternoon, the head of Ford will call me and say Mr. President, we've decided to build in the United States. That will happen. OK? That will happen. If they're really tough, they'll wait until the next day. But I guarantee you by 5:00 the next day, they're back. And that's great. That's what we need. We need jobs. We can't keep giving out our jobs. You know, college debt. I go all over and I see the vets are mistreated in this country so badly. Believe me. You know, they did a poll. I'm like the most popular person with the vets. You know, I built the Vietnam memorial in downtown Manhattan, OK. And the vets like me a lot. And they did a poll and people were shocked. Why would you be shocked? Because I'm going to take care of the vets. The other one, college. College debt. It is out of control. And I go around and I see students. And by the way, you see what's happening with the college? I mean, you talk about like what they're doing. The prices of these colleges. The way they're rapidly raising. And students are borrowing money from different people but also from the government. It is the thing that the government makes money on, college students. No, it's true. They're making a lot of money on college debt. And the big thing we need is jobs. And students come up to me and they say, Mr. Trump, I'm borrowed and I can't even, I don't know how I'll ever pay it off. This is somebody that is a junior or a senior in college. And it is almost like they have no hope. To me, it is one of the saddest things I've seen in making the rounds. College students, college debt. And they say, and then I apply for jobs. One was telling me from a very good college. Actually a college in Iowa where I was, a great college. And they were saying, you know, I worked hard. I became a great student. I just became one of the top students in my college. And I can't get a job, he said. And a lot of them can't get jobs. So now they have the debt and they can't get jobs because China has our jobs and Japan has our jobs and so many other places have our jobs. We don't have jobs. So they get out and there is no place to go and they don't know what to do. We're going to solve the problem because we're going to bring back the jobs from China and we are going to bring back the jobs from Japan. And we're going to be fair. But if you look at the deficit, the trade deficit that we have with China, it is astronomical. People have said how are going to balance the budget? How about like making some good deals with China and Japan? Look at the trade deficits. I was in Los Angeles two weeks ago. I saw ships that were so big. I've never seen anything like it with cars from Japan. They're pouring off. We sell them, actually, you sell them some beef, right? This is one of the beneficiaries, beef. But honestly, if you ever look at the difference, the numbers here, it is so crazy. We send wheat. They send cars. That's all going to change. And we're going to have great relationships with these people. And you know, the amazing thing, every country in the world, thinks the United States is represent by stupid people, and they're right, of course. No, they're wrong. Very stupid people. And every country in the world, I mean, every country in the world, everybody makes money. And the funny things is we don't get along with anybody. Think of it. Here we have deals that are all bad and everybody hates us. I just came in. And I'm watching on television. That we're really in a very bad place with Russia. Now, we're working on the Ukraine and I think that is fine, but why isn't Europe sort of like leading that whole charge? Why do we always leading? We're working on the Ukraine. I think that's terrible and all that stuff. We've got a lot of problems. We're sending an f,22, brand new, gorgeous. And we have fighters, our best military people are going over there. And we're worried about the Ukraine. I think Ukraine is great. I think we should worry about the Ukraine. But you know, Germany is over there. Germany is far richer than we are. Germany has made a fortune. We protect Germany for no money, OK. We protect South Korea for no money. So Germany is over there, right? And they're not worried about it. But Obama is talking about the Ukraine. Germany said let these dopey people take care of us. And all the European countries. So we are sending our fighters. Now in North Korea, you have a situation where, you know, he's raring his head again. I just were had 4000 sets for. And 4000, that's a lot of sets. They're all made in South Korea. They don't make them in Iowa. I wish. Does anyone make television sets? They don't make them in Iowa. They don't make them anywhere in this country. So I ordered 4000. Samsung, it is LG, it is all of them. Right? They're all from South Korea. Sony is from Japan. Their sets aren't as good anymore, but that's OK. But they're good sets. They are great. I paid a fortune. Enough saying, they make a fortune. Look at the deficit that we have that South Korea. I love South Korea. I love all these countries. But why is it that we protect them? So this guy raises his head. Nuclear this, I'm going to wipe them out. We immediately send, we have 28000 troops over there which is nothing compared to the million that they have in North Korea, a big army. OK. They don't pay us anything. What are we doing? And you know what? Somebody said that's not nice. You're asking them to pay. How can we police? We're watching the Ukraine, we are watching South Korea, we are watching Germany, we are watching Japan. We protect Japan. We have a treaty with Japan. If Japan gets attacked, we have to immediately go to their aid. OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. That's a fair deal. No, no, that's the kind of deals we make. They have nothing. Don't worry about it. But if they get attacks, we have to go to Japan. Did you ever fly, that's a long flight. So we need smart people. And we can straighten this country out. We can make this country so, we can make it better than ever. We can make it better than ever. Saudi Arabia, I love Saudi Arabia. The people are very nice to me. They buy my apartments, you wouldn't believe it. It's true. They'll pay me anything. They have nothing but money. They have nothing but money. I have a beautiful plane. All of a sudden it doesn't look so good when I look at some of their planes. I'm jealous. It's terrible. I'm jealous. No, but Saudi Arabia, they make a billion dollars a day. In all fairness, that was before the, you know, oil went down. But now, let's say it is a half a billion. That's pretty good. You make a half billion a day. We protect them. We get nothing. And every time, if you think in Yemen those folks are after Yemen, then you ought to leave the room right now because you are not very smart. Yemen, did you ever see the border? It never ends. It is a straight line. It never ends. And you know what is on the other side, Saudi Arabia? The oil. If you think they are stopping at Yemen, they're looking for the oil. Don't forget I'm the one, the most militaristic person. I would build a military so strong, so powerful, so incredible, nobody would ever use it. Nobody would ever, we would never have to use it. I would have the best everything. You know, we have a military where we give to the allies, our allies. We give it to the wrong allies, by the way. You know that. We give it to the wrong allies. We don't give to the Kurds. We give to people. One bullet shot in the air, 2300 humvees, the best in the world. So I heard they left. And one day they abandoned 2300. I said no, no, no, you mean 23. You mean three. You mean two. You can't leave 2300. They abandoned 2300 armor plated, the best in the world humvees, 2300. Because one shot was fired in the air. These are the people we're helping. These are the people we're helping. And now the enemy has the humvees armor plated. And we have the ones where the non armored plated and our wounded warriors who are the greatest people we have in this country. They are the greatest. The greatest. And our soldiers aren't protected. And the enemy is because they have these great vehicles that they took. And that's just the humvees. You can go on to everywhere. They have the best equipment. So we have to get smart. And we have to know what we're doing. And I would build, I'm telling you. I am so into it. But in 2000, and Ann Coulter knows this. In 2004, as much as I am into the military, which I love and respect. I'm a huge fan of General Patton. I'm a huge fan of General Douglas MacArthur. To this day, he has the highest marks, I'm a person I believe in like marks and students and education. I think it is great. General Douglas MacArthur to this day has the highest rates in the history of west point. That means something. Nice thing. And we have to do something and we have to do it fast. We have to get the generals that are great. There was a general, I won't use his name, but he's leaving. And they said to him the other day about ISIS on television, what do you think about ISIS? Can we beat them? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be very hard to beat ISIS. And I said to myself can you imagine George Patton saying, oh, it would be hard? He would have them knocked out in three days and say where do I go from here? Where? Where? General Douglas MacArthur getting out with his corn cob pipe right out of the airplane looking out over the land that he just took. Can you imagine him? First of all they wouldn't go on television. They're too busy fighting. They want to win. They are too busy winning. We don't have winners anymore. We don't have winners in this country. But we're going to turn it around. We are going to have winners. Now, speaking of winners, this is so important. We all know about trade. We've covered it. It is horrendous. I'm going to get the greatest negotiations. We're going to make great trades. We're going to make a lot of money. We are going to be great. Everyone is going to love us, OK? We have, they're going to love us. So you know, funny before, in Business Week magazine, again, they had a story a while ago. The ten things the Chinese most want. Now, who is tougher, the Chinese on me? I love them and I respect them. I just hate what they do to. But who is tougher than me? The ten things, one of the ten things was anything Trump. Apartments, anything. Anything Trump. I say how could that be possible? Because maybe they respect me or maybe they respect us. I don't know. But anything Trump. OK. So we're going to be respected. We are going to be really respected. We shouldn't to go to Iraq. We did. We made a mistake. But we went out. We should have kept the oil. And you would have ISIS believe. You wouldn't have. Now, people say that's such a harsh statement. She said take oil? Who the hell has the oil? The Iraqi government is totally corrupt. ISIS is, just formed out of Iraq. So we shouldn't have gone in. And then the way Obama got out was a total catastrophe. And then I say total catastrophe. And I said, Reuters, 2004, July. I said don't go in because if you do that in Iraq, and I'm one that likes to be, like I love the strength of military. You have to use it in the right location. If you do that, you're going to allow Iran to take over because you are going to decapitate. They would two powers that were equal. They fight. They would go ten feet, ten feet, ten feet, then they rest. This goes on for decades. They go ten, ten, right? Am I right? So we decapitate one of them. Now, Iran is as we speak, meeting with Iraq to take over the country. And you know who is getting the oil, most of the oil? The stuff that ISIS doesn't have? China. Do you know that China is getting so much oil? Do you know what we get? Nothing. Thousands of lives. Wounded warriors who I love all over. $2 trillion, we have nothing. In Afghanistan, which a lot of people don't know not, it is very rich in minerals. We're fighting in Afghanistan and they have very amazing mountains and ridges. We are fighting in Afghanistan over the years. And on the other side of the mountain, they have massive excavation equipment from China. They're taking out all the minerals as we fight. We need people that are smart. We have people that don't get it. Look at the deal we have with Iran. Look at this deal. It is going to, in my opinion, lead to an arm race the likes of which there has never been. Countries are going to line up for nukes. You are going to have perhaps nuclear proliferation. You are going to see things that you have never seen take place in a short period of time. This is the deal that just the other day, it was determines after months. Did you ever see a deal take so long? The deal has been going on forever. They had our prisoners. We never asked for our prisoners. How about that? Having a deal is good. But we should have doubled and tripled up the sanctions and negotiate from strengths. We could have done it so easily. Instead we have Kerry that goes on bicycle races. He's 73 years old. 73 years old! And I said it the last time I spoke. I swear I will never enter a bicycle race if I'm president. I swear. I swear! He's in a bicycle race. He falls. He breaks his leg. This is our chief negotiator. He is walking in. They're looking at him like what smock this is. I watched actually on Charlie Rose. I watched the chief negotiator being interviewed by Charlie. And after five minutes, I tweeted @realDonaldTrump. I tweeted. I said this guy is too smart for Kerry. I was right. So we didn't get the prisoners. And you know what the excuse was? We didn't ask for them. We didn't want to make the deal too complicated. Think of it. They're fighting us in Yemen. We didn't ask anything about Yemen. Like don't fight us. We have a 24 day wait period. So if we think they're doing nuclear, we have to wait 24 days. But see, that's not the worst part. The worst part is the clock start ticking. It could be months. We have to notify. There is whole process. I mean, they could build, shoot and build a couple more shoot. And by that time we still wouldn't be in there checking. Like I can just see them sweeping the floor and painting it battle shipment gray. You know, when I was with my father in Brooklyn, I used paint the Roger's battleship gray. I would always like. You know what I mean by battleship gray? Shiny battleship gray. I can see them doing it. So what we're doing is crazy. So you have that. And then beauty of all and you heard it two days ago. After years, we just found out that they're going to do in the most important section, they're going to do their own inspections. Did you hear this? Iran. They are going to do their own inspections. Did you hear about this? With some of these guys didn't hear? Where the hell have you been for the last three days? Look at these guys. They're smart guys. Three days ago I heard it. Nobody knew. They are going to self inspect. It is so unbelievable that you just can't even talk about it. And here is another part. We're going to give them $150 billion plus. And even if the deal isn't approved, they get that. In other words, they get that regardless. You know, when I do a deal, when I buy something, I pay them when I guy product, right? Whatever it is. I buy a building. I buy a business. I pay them. I put up a deposit and, right? But I pay them when the deal closes. We're paying them even if the deal doesn't happen. I've never heard of this before. I don't know who came one this idea. It must have been Kerry. No, it must have been. Because I don't think the Iranians. You know, the Iranians, Persians are great negotiators. They are natural great negotiators. I don't believe they would have thought of this because it is so crazy. No, it's true. They wouldn't have actually said, let's do this because it is so far out. Who would have ever think of it? They get $150 billion plus, plus, even if the deal is voted down and the deal doesn't happen which the deal will probably happen because we have a lot of weak people that are going to approve that deal just like they approved Obamacare. You know, you elected people who would knock out Obamacare. They got to Washington. Something happened. I promise it is not going to happen to me. Something happens in Washington. They get elected. They're really going to do a job. They are all. We're going to end Obamacare. We're going to fight. We are going to end this horrible thing with the $5 billion Web site that doesn't work to this day, by the way, $5 billion. I have about 40 websites that cost me $3 and they work. So we're going to end Obamacare. You probably elected some of them of they go to Washington. I don't know. There is something about Washington. They look at the beautiful buildings, these beautiful halls. And all of a sudden, they become impotent. Is that an appropriate word? I think so. They become just, it doesn't work. Put those two together. Something happens to them. And all of a sudden they're not fighters. I think they're so impressed. They show their wives. Look where I'm working. I'm working in Congress. Of course I have to vote for Obamacare. Isn't it wonderful? Look what I am doing. But they got elected to knock it out. What happened to these people? What happened? So something happens when people get elected and go to Washington. The beauty of Washington. I'm building as you know, the old post office. Can you imagine? President Obama is in charge of government services who are tremendous people, by the way. They really are. They are very talented people. That's because they chose me. If they didn't choose me, I probably wonderful say that. But they are talented. They are great people. Now, we're doing a great hotel, one of the greatest hotels. I think it will be one of the greatest hotels anywhere in the world. But think of it. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after pieces of property right smack on Pennsylvania between Congress and the White House. Best location. You know, for the real estate people, they notice that any time you get a post office, it's good. You know, the post office was always there first. I have the old post office in Washington, DC So it is being converted to Trump international. It is going to be great. And just think of that. I got it from the Obama administration. To this day, I say, are you sure we got that? I tell you. But we're doing a great job. And here's the thing. We are head of , think of this. Compare this to government. We're way ahead of schedule. And we're under budget. Did you ever hear that before? You don't hear that. So we have a great country. We have a country with tremendous potential. The potentials here are people. We have great people. We have problems all over the place, but they're problem that's can be solved. We have to incentivize people. We have to give people spirit. When President Obama was elected, one thing I thought would happen, I really thought he would be a unifier. You look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis the other night, you look at Chicago, you look at so many different places, and you look at what's happening with the African American youth. It has never been in worse shape. Never. You look at what's happening with so many other aspects of our country. And there's a racial divide, there is a divide, period. There's hatred all over the country. I've never seen it like this. We have to unify the country. We have to spiritize the country. We have to create jobs. We have to do a tremendous amount of work. But it can be done quickly. I will say this. If the right person is not elected, come next year, I don't know if it can be brought back again no matter how confident and capable the person is. It is going to be too far down the line. No, it is going to be too far down the line. So just in closing, and you know, normally I would do questions. But this has been such a good time and everyone has heard such a brilliant speech. And you know, I was with Elton John. Anybody like Elton John? And a lot of times, like he'll do this last song. And it is so great. It is so unbelievable. The place is standing and roaring and going incredible. And then they'll be like, they'll come back for like three more, right? And the three are not as good as the last one. And people go, let's get out of here. So you know, you like to leave on a high note. And I just like to say this is a great audience. But I have, thank you. I love you too. Thank you. But you know, I have a statement. I say it all the time. And I told the story once before. And it is that the American dream is dead. But I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than before. Right? Good. But I got home one night. And my wife said that was such a terrible thing you said. It was all over television. And the problem I have with television, look. They're all live. What do I do? Every night I'm on live television. I suppose to make speeches. How do you make the same speech? I'm trying to change it up. But every night, CNN, FOX, NBC, everybody. Look at them. They're all live. It's not fair. No, no. These other guys, they go around, they make a speech in front of 21 people. Nobody cares. They make the , they read the same speech. They have Teleprompters. I say we should outlaw Teleprompters for anybody, right? For anybody, for anybody running for president. You how easy that would be? Instead of this. I'm working my ass off. OK? Instead of this I can just stand up. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, it's wonderful to be in Iowa. You know, everybody is going to fall sleep and half an hour we leave. No mistakes. No problems. But I walk in but they are always live, these guys. I think we are going, let's start canceling them a little bit. And by the way, they're getting phenomenal ratings. That's why they're live. They're getting phenomenal ratings. And you know, the old days, when I was with the Apprentice, they paid me a lot of money. They don't pay me anything. You know, for the debate, we had 24 million people. Now, normally there would be like two million people, right? When you say two million if they are lucky. They had 24. I won't take credit for but believe me, 100 percent it's me, 100 percent. It's true. It's true. So the ratings came out. They were so big and so, it was the biggest rating in the history of cable television or something like that. And you know, I was a little obvious, but that is OK. So it happens. I'm saying to myself well, if it's not me, I should go to CNN. They're doing the next debate. And I should I say that Jeff Zucker, a great guy, Jeff, I'm going to do the debate but I want $10 million for charity. American cancer society, AIDS research. We'll pick ten great, a million. Otherwise I'm not going to the debate. And honestly, I think they would pay me. I do. I'm, 100 percent for charity. But it might not look right, I don't know, Ann. I'm going to have to think about it. I sort of like it. Does anybody like that idea? Then we go to Roger Ailes. He is a great guy at FOX and we say Roger, you know, they did so great at CNN. You did so great at FOX. Let's make it like 12, 15, 18, all for charity. But I'm thinking about it, I am thinking about it, believe me. So I go home, my wife says to me, you know, what are you doing? What are you doing? It was a horrible thing you said. I said, why? What did I say? You said the American dream is dead. I said, I didn't say that. I turned on the television. TiVo is wonderful. I turn it on and they have it cut. It is the American dream is dead. Cut. I said, what a terrible statement. But what I do say, and I say it all the time, the American dream is to a large extent, it is in trouble, but we're going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And, and we are going to win the nomination, and we are going to get the greatest people that have ever represented, we'll get the smartest, toughest, best people to represent us against the world. And we are going to make our country so great again, you're going to be so proud of it. And it is an honor to be with you tonight, and I really look forward to being with you for many, many years to come. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Donald Trump finishing a speech in Dubuque, Iowa. It lasted more than 50 minutes, walking off to Twisted Sister, We're not Going to Take It, the theme song there. Hello, everyone. I'm John Berman, sitting in for Anderson tonight. What a night it was in Dubuque, where in addition to this 50 plus minute speech, Donald Trump also gave a news conference, and man, were there fireworks there. Univision anchor Jorge Ramos got bounced, thrown out of the room, then invited back. There were more shots as well from Mr. Trump aimed at Jeb Bush. A lot to talk about tonight, so let's bring in our panel. Amanda Carpenter, former communications director for Senator Ted Cruz. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. Republican consultant and former top Trump campaign adviser, Roger Stone, and CNN political commentator Peter Beinart, who also teaches journalism and political science at the City University of New York and is a contributing editor for Atlantic Media. Amanda, let me start with you, let's start on the speech. We have a lot to go over tonight, including Jorge Ramos getting thrown out of the news conference. But let's start with the speech. 50 minutes, hit a lot of subjects. Another way to say it is it was rambling. He talked about Iran, he talked about immigration, he talked about the economy, he talked about China and he talked about The Apprentice. What struck you? Thank you very much. I see these beautiful teleprompters. Believe me, I'm not using them. You know I said if you run for president you should not be allowed to use teleprompters. Get these things out of here. I was watching Hillary making a speech and it was outside. And they were dead, dark, big. They weren't even like this. These are clears. I can almost see right through them, but, which really is disturbing. Is that disturbing to the audience, wouldn't you think? But hers, because it was outside, were black, and they were twice the size. I said what kind of a speech is that? That's not a speech. Most importantly, I brought my Bible. Okay? And, you know, it's First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica. And this was written by my mother with my name, with, it was a long time ago, with my name, with my address, with everything. In case I lost it, somebody would return it. You know, in the old days, if you lost something, they returned it; today a little bit less so. But I saw this and I said I have to bring it and just show it, because it brings back so many memories. It's really an honor to be here. And, you know, David is a fantastic guy. He's done an amazing job. And we had some big news today with Boehner. And, you know, I've been saying for a long time, and I was just telling, actually, David, who said, by the way, I'm not a politician and I'm not politically correct. And I think that's a great thing. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of the political, I love this guy over here. Thank you. I'm so tired of the time and the effort of all of this. We don't have time. We have a country that's in such danger and such trouble. To be politically correct, every word is measured. And I can do it. I went to great schools. I went to an Ivy League school. So easy to do it. But who wants to do it? We have to get to business. I mean, we have to just get back to business. But we're going to have a very interesting period of time. And maybe it starts today, because Speaker Boehner, you know, some people like him on a personal basis. Do people like him on a personal basis? Anybody? You know, we want to see, we want to see the job being done properly. We want to see, we want people that are going to get it done. And I don't understand. They get elected. They're full of vim and vigor. They're going to change things. They're going to get rid of Obamacare. They're going to do all of these things. They come down to these magnificent vaulted ceilings that you see all over Washington. And what happens? They become different people. They become different people. They come out and they don't do it. And I will say, you know, for the groups that want to take what they say is a harsh tone, I wrote The Art of the Deal. And I will tell you, The Art of the Deal, if they would have read it, some of, and I'm talking about the Republicans. We know where the Democrats are coming from. But we are so disappointed in the Republican establishment, because if they stuck together, in all fairness, you have a certain group of 10 percent, 12 percent of Republicans that are out there fighting, fighting. But when the other side, which is Obama and the Democrats, when they hear that they're not going to win and they have no support, there's no way, from The Art of the Deal, there's no way that they can possibly win, that the Republicans can win. So they're out there. They're left hanging so many different times. If they actually were unified, if they were brought together and unified, and you said four very important things that you're going to take very, very strong, harsh measures, you're going to win, because nobody's going to, in 50 years from now, in 100 years from now, in two years from now, and even next month, nobody's going to be talking about the speaker. Nobody's going to be talking about any of the, they're going to be saying let's say something very important. The government shut down. They're blaming the president, folks. They're blaming the president. And, you know, it's sort of interesting. When you hear the Democrats, they're very, very good, very, very good. They go, oh, we want the government to shut down. We want it to shut down. That would be so great if it shut down. It would be so wonderful if it shut down. And the Republicans say, oh, they want it to shut down. Oh, that would be bad. We're playing right into their hands. These people are babies. Do you remember when they said they want to impeach, do you remember, no, they're babies. They're babies. Do you remember when they said they wanted to impeach, a small group wanted to impeach Obama? Right? Remember? And then the Democrats said, no, no, we want him to be impeached. We want him to be impeached. Please impeach him. It would be so good for him. It will make him look so good. And he'll get all of his points out. It'll be wonderful. Do you really think they want him to be impeached? So the Republicans come back. I was just telling the folks backstage, the Republicans come back. Oh, we don't want to do that because he wants to be. Who wants to be impeached? Oh, it's so sad. I mean, you know, like, you have this clown, Marco Rubio. I've been so nice to him. I've been so nice. I've been so nice. And then, no, but he's in favor of immigration, and he has been. He has been. It was the gang of eight. And you remember the gang of eight. It was terrible. And then he went down in the polls. And you have to stay. You know what? If you believe in something, you have to be true to yourself. You have to be. You have to be. But it was the gang of eight and it was really, really, you talk about weak on immigration; nobody weaker. And all of a sudden he goes down in the polls and all of a sudden he starts changing his tone. But you never really change your tone. You remember that. And also, when you're elected senator, you have to go and vote. It's so important. You can't say I can't vote. And he's got the worst record. And he hit me. And I said why is he doing that? And sometimes the Republicans do it more than anybody because they want to sort of catch on. They want to get into the publicity cycle. And all you're doing is hurting yourselves. I mean, it's a bad thing. All you're doing is hurting yourselves. Now, we have so many people that can be and should be attacked. We have a president that is extremely bad for everything that the folks in this room stand for, I mean, extremely bad. You know, freedom of religion, so important. We just don't see it. You know, you take a look at a thing like the Iran deal. We talk freedom of religion, look at the Iran, how long is this whole thing going to last when we have incompetent people, grossly incompetent people negotiating these vital deals like that deal where 24 days and all, I don't have to go over all of the many problems with the deal. Even Israel, Israel is in such trouble with this deal. And you know in that deal probably it says, and nobody even understands what says, which is a problem, but probably if Israel ever attacked Iran, we're supposed to come to their defense. Do we know that? Nobody's able to tell us what is going on with respect to that. If Israel has to, because at some point something might happen. The deal is horrible. The deal is horrible, from any standpoint. And we have to do something. And I can say it's going to have to be renegotiated. You know, I've made a living of buying bad, I love bad deals, because you buy them cheap, do you understand that? You buy them cheap. I love horrible contracts. I love buying, I bought them from friends of mine. I buy a horrible, horrible contract. The poor guy is dying with it. He's getting killed. I buy it cheap. I then go and fight like hell and make it a great contract. Sometimes you chapter it, some, you do lots of different things, whatever you have to do. And you make it a great contract. That contract, that agreement has to be changed. We have no choice, because if it isn't you're going to have nuclear proliferation, it's already happening. You're going to have potentially the destruction of Israel. It has to be changed. One of the things in that contract that I cannot believe, we're giving them $150 billion. Right? No, we're giving them $150 billion of which they're going to use, and already are using, they're ordering missiles from Russia. They're doing things that probably and definitely we can't allow them to do. But they're doing it. We cannot allow the incompetence that we've had going on in this country. We just can't, we have to use our greatest negotiations. We have to use our smartest people. We use political hacks, they're all political hacks. They're negotiating deals that they should, they have no right doing it. Take a look at another thing, one thing, and, look, nuclear's so important, but you have four prisoners. One of them's over there because he's a Christian. He's over in jail because he's a Christian. Now, at the beginning of the negotiation, by the way, it used to be three at the beginning, now it's four. But you say very simply before you start, fellas, and by the way I have to say, to the women, it's all fellas over there. They haven't figured out that women are smarter than men. They haven't figured this out yet. A little detail. They'll figure. It'll take another 150 years, but they'll figure it. You say, fellas, you got to give us back our prisoners. You got to do it. You got to do it. No, you got to do it. You got to give us back our prisoners. Now, they went to Kerry who is, you know, broke his leg playing, this guy's in a bicycle race, can you believe it? He's in a bicycle race. He's got the hat. He's got the emblem. I said, what's he doing? He as actually in a race. It wasn't just like let's get a little exercise. Breaks his leg. This is our negotiator, all right? So he walks in, he walks in with crutches. And they say, what the hell is with this guy? Is he crazy? We have to very simply, as an example, that example. You walk in at the beginning, not the end, not the end. You say, fellas, before we start, you have four prisoners. You don't want them. We do. It would send a great signal to the American people. It'll make the deal much easier. You'll make another deal. It'll make it much easier. You got to give us back. If they say no, you take a walk because you know you're not going to get anything. You take a walk. You take a walk. And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, as sure as you're sitting there, that within a short period of time they call back, you have your prisoners, you have them. But here's the worst, it isn't even, and you need the right messenger. If I'm the messenger, you get those prisoners back. I tell you what, I tell you what, I'll make this statement. If I get elected president, before I ever get to office, I guarantee you they will be back, I guarantee 100 percent. A hundred, that's a hundred percent. But you need the right messenger. And in the case of the prisoners, they never even asked. Can you believe it? They said, both Obama and Kerry said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations. No, no, I mean, this was really a statement. We don't want to complicate. So it's time. I'm a business man. I made a tremendous amount of money, a tremendous amount. It's ridiculous. I mean, I don't even believe it myself. You want to know the truth? I don't even believe it. I'm self funding, I don't want to have the lobbyists and the special interests put money into my campaign. I'm turning down, by the way, I'm turning down millions of dollars. I've turned down millions and millions of dollars. I actually feel foolish because it's so anti me. It' so, like, it's not me. But I turn down millions and millions. And yet, you know, I was in Iowa two weeks ago. And I had a great audience. We had a, we've had just such great people and great crowds. And I said to the people, do you mind if I take millions of dollars? I promise you I won't do anything for the people giving me the money? Do you mind? And they all stood up and they said no, no, no. It was really important. I didn't know it was going to be that important. Anyway, I think self funding's great. I'm the only one that's self funding. Everyone else, believe me, whether it's Bush, who by the way, along with Rubio, but whether it's Bush or anybody in favor of common core. I mean, I think of it. Now, you talk from a Christian standpoint. You want local school representation. You want local. Common Core is a disaster. But you people that really are tough and smart. You look at another thing, trade. That's what I'm, oh, I'm going to do so good. I always say I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. That I tell you. That I tell you. You know, people say, and actually, CNN did a poll and I come out so high on that, on the economy. And by the way, like much, much higher, not even close. I come out the highest by far on that. And leadership, I come out high on leadership. And I come out high on really other categories. Then I say, if I'm so high in all these categories, why do we even have to have an election, right? Why? Why? But a woman stood up, because I didn't sue, you know, the one thing I was a little weak on, people were not sure I was a nice person. And I am. I am. I am. I am, I'm a giving person. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. I'm a Christian. I'm, you know, I have a lot of reasons. I love, I love people. But the woman stood up. She said, Mr. Trump, I'm a big fan of yours and I'm going to vote for you, but I don't know if you're nice enough to get elected. I said, I really think I'm a nice person, but let me tell you something: I really think this is going to be an election based on competence. We need now competence. And we have to have something. We, we need help. We owe China $1 trillion. Think of it. They suck our money out, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. How does that work? Not so good. No, we owe them. Supposed to be the other way around, right? Japan. We owe them the exact same amount, $1 trillion. They sell us cars, biggest boats you've ever seen coming into the harbors. You've never seen boats, I've never seen ships like this. They're loaded, loaded with cars. So they send millions of cars over here. We sell them beef, beef. They don't want it. Half the time they send it back. They want to send it back. The farmers over there don't want it. So we take it back. That's not good beef by the time you get it back. I said the other day, no, no, I say it's aged; now they call it Kobe beef and we sell it for more money, you know, it's one of the,. But, but you look at the imbalance, the US trade, I mean, look at, look at the US trade. China, almost $400 billion a year we lose. Japan, $75 billion a year. Mexico, they all say the fence. First of all, we are going to build a wall, and it's going to be a real wall, OK? If people like it or don't, we're going to build a wall. And it's going to have a big, beautiful door, and people are coming to come into the country, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come into the country legally. And when people graduate number one in their class from Harvard and Yale, we don't send them out. And they want to stay in the country. You know, there was a case the other day I read about where somebody, a great student at a great school, couldn't stay. From India, couldn't stay in the country, no matter what. And they forced him out. And he founded a company a few years ago in India, 5000 employees, one of the most successful companies, an unbelievable job. We could have had him here, and we force them out. Silicon Valley needs people. We all need people. But we force these incredible people that have been in our system for years, we force them out. They graduate, boom, get out. So we've got to be smart. We've got to be tough. We can't allow our veterans to be treated the way they're treated. They're treated horribly. They're treated horribly. And our military? If I win, we're going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful nobody will ever mess with us, folks. We are really in serious trouble. You have, you have Putin the other day, not so long ago, saying, you know, they better be careful, we have nuclear missiles. I've never heard, you know, coming from Russia. But you have North Korea, you have so many other places. I brought up recently, you know, during the debate, anybody watch the debate, by any chance? How did I do? How did I do? Right? I won every single poll, and yet these media people, oh, Donald Trump didn't, I won every poll. I won Drudge. I love Drudge. I love Drudge. But I won Drudge. I won Time magazine. I won every single poll, Slate, places I never even heard of. I won every poll. Then I turn on the television and even, I think the Fox poll had me at second, and they, they wouldn't say it. They wouldn't tell. They wouldn't say I was in second. Other polls, they said I did great. Then I'm listening to some of the pundits. I won't use their name, because actually some of them are getting better, you know, as I get higher and higher. We're doing great. In fact, with Evangelicals in Iowa, just came out, I'm number one at 29 percent, substantially ahead of anyone else. I'm happy about that. You know why? That's the reason. That's the reason. But, but we have to be careful, as Christians. The progressives are pushing, the progressives are pushing to an extent that, if we're not careful, we're going to have some big problems, and even bigger than we have right now. Look, we need people that can support us. We need people that are strong and smart and can back us. The word Christmas, I love Christmas. I love Christmas. You go to stores now, you don't see the word Christmas. It says Happy Holidays all over. I say, where's Christmas? I tell my wife: don't go to those stores. I want to see Christmas. No, I want to see Christmas. And you know, other people can have their holidays, no. But Christmas is Christmas. I want to see Merry Christmas. Remember the expression Merry Christmas? You don't see it anymore. You're going to see it if I get elected, I can tell you right now. I can tell you right now. So I just want to thank you for the, it's been an amazing group of people. You've been amazing. And to have such a fantastic room. But I just want to thank everybody. You know, I got into this and everyone said, there's no way he'll ever do it, he's got this wonderful company, he's got, I do. I have a wonderful life. But I see what's happening. I see what's happening with the country. I see so many things going wrong, so many things that are caused really by incompetence, that can be straightened out. We can straighten it out fairly quickly. I will tell you if we don't stop it now, however, it's going to be, at some point it's going to be too late. You're not going to be able to turn it. You're not going to be able to turn it. But I got in and they said, you know, he'll never do it. So I did it. They all said, oh, he did it. Then they'll say, he'll never file, like, form A, which is basically a single page where you're signing your life away. I signed it. I signed form A. They said, oh, I don't believe it. Then they said he'll never put in his financials because maybe he's not as big financially as everybody thinks. I put in my, almost a hundred pages, like the biggest ever filed by far, by far, and I had it ahead of, but you know, they said, oh, he'll ask for all the extensions. And you had some of the politicians asking for extensions and they were one page. I put it in ahead of schedule, and it turned out the company was much bigger than anybody thought, much stronger. It was, it's an amazing company, right? So they said, this guy might be running. Then I go with the polls, and the polls go up just like the Evangelicals in Iowa. The polls, I start, bing, bing, bing, bing. And every single two or three weeks, when the polls come out, they said, well, now he's reached his cap. I started at 6 percent. It went to 9 percent. It went to 12 percent. It was like a rocket ship, right? You've seen it. I mean, I'm not telling you anything. And, and it went to 20 percent and it went to 22 percent. Then it went, and then the other day, in a Fox poll, it went up 2 percent. And I'm killing everybody. And they say, other people are surging, Trump is staying still. But I'm up! I went up. I didn't stay still. I went up 2 points, right, a big two points. And I had another one where I'm 33 percent, 33 percent, and the next one I think was like 12 percent or 15 percent, and they don't want to report it. They don't put the poll out. I said, why aren't you putting the poll out? Well, we don't like that poll. This is a great poll. It's a great poll. And they wouldn't put it out. So, you know, I get angry at these things, because you know what I like? I like fairness. Somebody said, do you have thin skin? I don't. If I'm wrong about something, I don't mind, the media can do whatever they want. But I have thin skin when I'm right about something when I know they're doing a number on all of us, because when I ran, and the reason I ran is because I want to make this country great again. And we're going to do it. We're going to do it. And we're going to do it a lot faster and a lot better than anybody thinks is possible. And I just want to thank everybody. You're special people and I love you all. And this is the key. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I guarantee you that young woman who just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting, disgusting. So we're taking about the media, and by the way some of the media's terrific. But most of it, seventy percent, seventy five percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that scum! They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished a speech and they said, Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. Like, uh, I spoke for forty five, fifty minutes. I then answered question, questions. And then I went around to you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly there's a media group that calls the media. And the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there little Katy she's back there. What a lie it was, no, what a lie, Katy Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that, it was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this, where they actually criticized the media and they said it was a total lie. And I love you, I love you, I love you. And then other people pick it up, you know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter, remember that, third rate, third. It's possible. It's possible. Look, my whole campaign is about honesty. We have a problem. People said, Oh, that's not politically correct, what he said about surveillance. But we have to have some surveillance. You had to see the whole speech. It was so good. That was when Carson went down. That was the thing that totally took him down. In Iowa, big audience. No, that may have been the beginning of the end but my speech is when he really began to go down. I talked about his book and in his book he says he has pathological disease. I mean, he actually says it. There's no cure for it. I compared it to a child molester because there is no cure for child molesting, other than , well, you know. Nobody. Then I talked about taking the lock at his friend's face, taking a hammer to his mother's head. Then about the belt. You didn't see the whole speech. That's the problem with what I did and won't do again. You saw what I said and it was fine. You have to see the whole speech to understand. I started talking about it and explaining, and then I showed how it doesn't work that way. I moved over and took the belt, demonstrated what I meant. People there got it. What they do, the dishonest press does, is one second of me playing with my belt. People go, What the fuck is he doing? They don't know it was about the knife going into the belt. They haven't seen the whole speech and what I was saying about how a belt doesn't stop a knife. I was showing a knife, a knife going into a belt isn't stopped by the belt. So, if you watch the speech, it took down Carson. That was the beginning of the end for Carson. I figured I had to do it. You know the expression in golf: Johnny, he's just hanging around. The guy was just hanging around. I couldn't understand it. He was just hanging around. It's fine when you put them both in. You can't put in just the one. That's only fair. I'm a deal guy. I've been winning all of my life. Like this property. I bought it six, seven years ago. I bought it for a steal. Eight hundred acres on the Potomac River. I bought it for nothing. I could sell it for anything. I'm not selling, but I could sell it for anything. My whole life is about winning. I always win. I win at golf. I'm a club champion many times at different clubs. I win at golf. I can sink the three footer on the 18th hole when others can't. My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose. In Massachusetts, I'm at 48 percent. You know why? Tom Brady said Trump's the greatest. He says it to anyone who asks him. You know, it's hard for a guy like him to say that. When you're a football player, you don't want to be taking sides in campaigns and having the Hillary Clinton people now say you're not as good as Bart Starr. You understand. So Tom Brady is great. Hey, look. I went through a depression, a real estate depression that was massive in 1990. The last one I made a lot of money because I was a buyer , like I bought this at the bottom of the market. I can tell , I'm so good at real estate, I've made billions of dollars. Tell me the day you bought the property and I'll tell you if you made a good deal. I made such a mistake with Chuck Todd because I told such a truthful , he asked me would I ever get out? I thought, Huh? I'm leading in all of the polls. Would you ever get out? I said, Look, if for some reason that I wasn't leading in the polls, that I wasn't getting the acclaim or the biggest audiences , and I'm getting the biggest crowds by far, much bigger than Bernie Sanders ever had. Nobody reports that, but anyway. We had 12000 people in Sarasota at 12 o'clock on a Saturday. Last night, we had a group in Manassas, they were so packed in. They couldn't get them in. You saw. So, I said to Chuck, honestly, if I'm down and not getting crowds, if I was down in the polls. I'm a believer in the polls by the way. Rarely do you see a poll that's very far off. Let me just say That interview was a couple of months ago. If I see that I'm not going to win, I'd get out. I'm not a masochist. I go home and I see my wife. She's always a good critic. She says, That was a great answer. Other people say the same. He hated it. I said, What's wrong? The only one who hated it was Corey. He was going like, Oh shit. But I quickly understood why. He was right. The next day, the headlines: Trump may leave race. He's a good guy, really good guy. Say hello to him for me, will you? You know, his best golf story ever was about Mike Donald, who almost won the 1990 US Open. He was leading the US Open going into the final hole. He was an early starter. A rabbit. In other words, he was a good golfer who never made $10, who was on the tour for 10 years. Leading the US Open. Had a great final round but he was in the middle of the pack. Two hours to go and everyone said he was going to win the US Open. He wasn't supposed to win the US Open because he was a rabbit. Jack Nicklaus, all the others, they're the kind of guys who usually win. So he's in the clubhouse, leading the US Open, everyone's doing great, watching it on TV. And then Hale Irwin goes crazy on the course. You remember? Irwin goes to the 18th hole, he's one down to Mike Donald, who no one had ever heard of. And Hale Irwin sinks a 97 foot putt. That was the one where he ran around the green. Now Irwin has the privilege of playing Donald in a playoff the following day. A full 18 hole playoff. Hale Irwin, naturally, wins because the other guy never wins. The champion always wins. Bamberger did one of the greatest stories ever on that. The next day they show Mike Donald, two pictures. One has him on Sunday and Monday, Mike Donald playing to thousands of people up and down the fairway, 20 rows deep, as he walks up the 18th hole at the US Open. Pictures. The next day, he doesn't win, he's seen walking up a fairway, nobody there, no money, his wife carrying the bag. If he had won, it'd have been a life changing experience. But he didn't win. Those pictures, famous, I remember them. A thing like that is always a possibility. It's never happened because I've been having this for a long time. I write a book, it becomes the Number One selling business book of all time. The Art of the Deal. All of my books have done well. The current book does well I don't even have time to promote it. Have I spent 10 minutes promoting it? I didn't take three weeks off, going all over the place to promote it. You sell thousands of books a day if you do that. So the book, the show. The Apprentice had some great run, it was the Number One show. What a lot of people don't realize is that I gave up a lot to do this not just deals but a two hour primetime television show for another two years. Don't kid yourself. I've always been there. In school, I was always successful. In life, I was always successful. My father was a successful real estate developer and he was a very tough man but a good man. My father would always praise me. He always thought I was the smartest person. He said to one of the big magazines that everything he touches turns to gold. At a very young age. So I don't know. It's the thing that number one, it's my hair. Number two, what don't people really understand? Those are the two questions I always get. Number one, my hair is real. It's me. I've seen these old pictures, I combed it the same way. Okay. I have a friend, Bill Zanker, who's a very smart guy. He said, If you didn't go through those difficulties in the early 1990s, when the press was just tearing you apart, you wouldn't be nearly as big as you are now. Again, I never went bankrupt, but I went through a lot, owed billions and billions of dollars. The press loved it, they were killing me, not talking about other people. I said to him, That's wrong. He said, No. If you didn't fight through it and become bigger than ever, you'd never be as big as you are now. Interesting thought. That's his feeling. I'm not sure if I agree. But you understand what he's saying. It showed a human something. Tell your son I think I'm a very nice person who gets along very well with people. I'm very loyal, to a fault. My wife said, You're too nice too long and then when you go bad, then you're too bad. Then she said, You get too vicious and you never forgive. You put up with too much too long. You get screwed by somebody. You're too nice, and then you flip, it's too long, too nasty, too horrible. Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor. We don't want that stuff. We don't want World Trade Centers. We don't want that ever happen to us again. It's not going to happen to us again. So I want to thank everybody for being here. It's a great honor. They have thousands of people outside and sometimes they'll say Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in? But we can't get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We're together tonight. Thank you. So we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa, great, great state, and in Iowa, Trump 33 percent. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20 percent and Carson at 16 percent and going down and Rubio at 11 percent and Bush at 4 percent. But it's Trump at 33 percent. It just came out. It's Iowa, we love Iowa. By the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I've been on that one too. A really great one. The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36 percent and then I won't even mention the other numbers because they're so low. You know, when you have so many people running, we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you'll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don't know. When somebody's down at zero I would think that eventually they'll drop out. The only difference is there's nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you'll be seeing that. One of the things I think that's so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy, so important, Trump 55 percent. Everyone else nothing. On the budget, I'm really good at these things, economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump, this is with 15 people remaining, Trump 51 percent. Everyone else bing. Oh, here's one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we're talking about today. I guess you've heard a little bit about it. But I've taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me. You know, all of my life, I've heard that if you're a successful person, especially if you have very success, you've done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can't run for president. And yet, that's the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs. We're being run by people that don't know what they're doing. Very sad. On illegal immigration, Trump 48 percent. That's with 15 people. Everyone else, no good. On a thing called ISIS, oh, don't worry. We'll have plenty, we'll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it? Here we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people, a lot of military people here. Who's military here? All right, I love you. By the way, speaking of it, we're going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody's ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They're never going to mess with us. You know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don't know what we're doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we're going to make it so great, so strong that people, gosh, they're not messing. They're not messing. And we're going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We're going to take care of them. Because they, thank you, they are not being taken care of. We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it's not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. So with ISIS, Trump 46 percent. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running. On foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say Well, maybe it's not my thing. But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that's it. I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know why he was there. He refuses to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He refuses to use the term. I don't even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don't. And then we're looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It's just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse. She's got no strength. She's got no stamina. Remember that. You don't need a president with no strength or stamina when we're being ripped off on trade, we're being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good. When our soldiers aren't being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today. One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we're the least prepared now than anytime that he's ever seen it and he's been there a long time retiring. That's how we are. In the most dangerous world we've ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don't know, they don't, I'm telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed. Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed? , They'd be interviewed after total and complete victory. Gen. Douglas MacArthur. They're not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later. These guys, and I don't think we'll have to. You know, just so you understand, Bush, Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he'll be elected. He's at what 3 percent? Right? No, but he said some things and I was like, I said Who says that about an opponent? You don't say those things. You'll find out what he said. But he said very nice things. But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone, the tone, of Donald Trump is not nice. And I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they're Christian and for other reasons. They're being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone. Hillary said the same thing. Mr. Trump's tone is not nice. These people are living in a different planet. Different planet. And remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who's strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things. You know, I know a lot of tough people but they're not smart. That's no good. They're easy. We need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country. We owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It's a, think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word. We owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We're really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military. And yet, we do deals with China where there's a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question. Japan, they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That's like a loss. You look at Mexico. We're going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It's gonna happen. The people I'm dealing with, and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there's 15 of us. I had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they've all gone down. We've got to keep it that way, right? I mean, Lindsey Graham. He's at zero. He's at zero. Zero. Let me ask you a question. I don't get Lindsey Graham. I don't get him, He's literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he's on television all the time and he doesn't go up. He's at zero, folks. His ideas are so bad. I'm more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn't. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn't know where the hell, ha ha. And he always sits with John McCain. It's like they're the Bobbsey twins. They're always sitting together. No, it's true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He's always sitting with John McCain, who's fine. I'm not knocking it. But you got to know what to do. Now me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament, I have a great temperament. But you've got to attack. If you've got to do something, you've got to know what you're doing. I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you're going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me. And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, Fellas, you're going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that's what's happening. And Iran's going to take over Iraq as sure as you're sitting there. And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left. And we have a president, we shouldn't have been there but then we shouldn't have left the way we left. You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans, wouldn't it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do? I'll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we're all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right? But you know, if you think about it and you'll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They're just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren't and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don't agree with me; they agree with the other side. But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we're not vigilant, that was the same person. I've got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I'll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don't you get her out because honestly it's inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up. See, our country has this kind of security. That's the problem we have, Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It's one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens. But you would think that everybody we're all on the same basket that everybody every single person, So you would think that if we could get together, we'd all be in the same boat. Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate. In fact, I tweeted Is that all there is? about the president's speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don't care. I don't care. You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn't notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. And I watched the next door neighbor saying, Oh, well we didn't report them because we didn't want to racially profile or we didn't want to profile. Give me a break. Give me a break. We're like the stupid country in so many different ways. It's so, can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that's happening with us? They didn't want to report them because they thought it was profiling. Okay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn't to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can't put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn't want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you're okay, you're innocent. Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center, the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were, but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center. So, what's happened is we're out of control. We have no idea who's coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what's going on. And then I looked at poll numbers and I don't mean polls where I'm winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it's very, very sad. I'll go after some of the numbers. 25 percent of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy, very highly respected group of people who I know actually. This is people living in this country. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25 percent. 51 percent of the Muslims living in this country, by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they're great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something's going on, and we can't put up with it, folks. We can't put up with it. 51 percent, 51 percent highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. So I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media, these people back here. They're the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest. I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right until the end. I had one of the politicians, Kasich, who is just getting, he's a horrible debater, He made a statement that Oh, they left after 10 minutes. Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody's leaving. Nobody's leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn't want to do that because it's not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don't want to show this crowd tonight. They're not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don't do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show, look at all the people over here. It's a record in the history of this ship. But they don't show it. They don't show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting. Disgusting. , And by the way, some of the media's terrific but most of it 70 percent, 75 percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly, there's a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there. Little Katie. She's back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie, Katie Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. And then other people pick it up. You know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate. So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don't want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple. It's very simple. So here's what happened. It's been a little controversial. It's been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that. But I have more, I wish we could call, is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn't you love that? Now they're coming at us in full force. They're coming, not coming at me. They're coming at all of us. They're coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They're fed up with incompetence. They're fed up with stupid leaders. They're fed up with stupid people. They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who, think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I've seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted. You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won't even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he's going to get away with nothing. He's going to have nothing. So he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, I shouldn't have done this. This isn't working out the way I thought. Anyways, so we get him back and here's the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed, They get five of their greatest killers that they've been after, after, think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years. So they get these, right now have gone, they're out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I'd hate to tell you. So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they've wanted for many years. That's the way we do it. The Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It's called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days, 24 days, we think there's something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it's much longer than that because there's a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever. But the best is where they have the right to self inspect. Are you doing nuclear weapons over there? Oh, we'll inspect tomorrow. Oh no, we're not doing nuclear weapons. You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that's profiling. Trust me, they're great negotiators. And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He's a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible. I always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said You know what? I don't think he's going to be a good president. I backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don't blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, This time I'm going to do it myself. We're not going to lose. We're not going to lose. We're not losing. And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That's so important. So, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it's impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night. And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy, Shall I read you the statement? Donald J. Trump is calling for, now, you've got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it's common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25 percent, 51 percent. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans, these are people that are here by the way, people that are here, 25 percent not 1 percent. By the way, 1 percent would be unacceptable. 1 percent is unacceptable. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part, think of that, as part of the global jihad. They want to change your religion. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Not going to happen. As part of the global jihad. And 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51 percent. Sharia authorizes, now look, this is, I mean, it's terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non believers who won't convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look, especially women. Tough stuff. And we have a president that won't even mention the term and you're talking about numbers like this. Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it's obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension, Where the hatred comes from and why, we'll have to determine. We'll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can't live like this. It's going to get worse and worse. You're going to have more World Trade Centers. It's going to get worse and worse folks. We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it's going to get worse and worse. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. These are people only believe in jihad. They don't want our system. They don't want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life. So they have no respect for human life. So we have to do something. Now, we can be weak. We can be ineffective. We can be foolish. So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn't have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn't had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn't had that carnage. So important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can't let these weak leaders diminish it. If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom! People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They're sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die. Now, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn't have guns. The bad guys had the guns. And these young people, and I tell the press you've got to stop calling them masterminds, these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren't masterminds. Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris, the mastermind. I was watching all the networks. I won't mention who but some of them disgusted me. The mastermind is on the loose. And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids, they go over there. They're young. They're impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS. And we have our anchors, I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don't hear it too much. But they say the young mastermind. Oh, he's brilliant. Young man, he's brilliant. I don't even he's got a high IQ, In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there, mastermind, bing, bing, bing, it's like shooting everybody. You've got to be a mastermind. So the press has to be responsible. They're not being responsible because we're losing a lot of people because of the Internet. And we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way. Somebody will Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We've got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They're leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. Oh, come on back. Where were you? I was fighting for ISIS. Oh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself. When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It's over. How about that? And now that they've become radicalized, they're totally radicalized. And how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn't get women. I don't know what the hell his problem is. It's probably the first women he's ever had. I don't know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree. Folks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what's happening because something is happening in there. Man, there's anger. There's anger. And we have to know about it. We can't be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things. We can't be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn't want to tell anybody. We can't be that. We have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don't worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise. So when I started this whole quest, I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It's been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed. We went to Dallas, 20000 people in Dallas. 25000 people. Mobile, Alabama, 35000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go, Florida, we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room, thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn't say I exactly love doing after the first one. But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms, all the same. I love you too. I love you, Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. There's an unbelievable love in all of these places, Oklahoma, 20000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There's an unbelievable love. And there's an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don't want to be bad people. We don't want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody. But we can't let people use and abuse our rights. We can't let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can't let it happen. We just can't let it happen. And I have a friend who's a very, very successful man, and I went to one event, he came with me. We had 24000 people. And this guy's a real tough cookie. He's a great financial guy. One of the guys I'd definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you're going to be in good shape when that happens. We won't have these characters. You know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I'm the only one that's self funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I'm the only one. Only one. I'm self funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they're getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know. I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, Honestly, I can't take it. I don't want to do. I can't take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money, my whole life I've been taking money. Now I'm sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, So what are you going to do? I don't want your money. And he said, I got to go someplace else. They're like gamblers. They're like gamblers. But I said, You like me best. I like you best but I'm going to go someplace else. Because they want to be part, they want to, , Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don't forget, I was the fair haired boy. I was like the establishment. They'd all come to me, and I'd give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max, bing, bing, bing. I used to say Senators, don't come to my office. Anybody that's a US Senator that calls me, we'll send you a campaign contribution. But you know what? I'll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS, they're corrupt, they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won't say Cruz because he's been very nice to me. Nah, he's been nice. He's got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you. No, I've been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don't know. He's a friend of mine but he's not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You've got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what's going on. Does that make sense by the way? Until we find out. And he talked about, that's inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right? But that's the statement of an inexperienced man, About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced? So Chris, who's a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won't do this a lot. Look, here's the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it. Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they're closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn't get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, Hey boss, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight. No, they never said that. They're talking about the weather, right? He knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don't think so. But I don't know. It's called life. You've got to be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They'd just say, Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you. Oh, okay. They didn't mention? Nobody believes that. Number two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It's a disaster. I have property over there, the taxes are through, I'll use an expression, coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, Let me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama? I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know. I think he possibly did. And Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it. So when Chris talks about, when he talks about lack of experience, I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said Wow, that is unbelievable. I would have probably filed them even when I didn't run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed. Everybody said Number one, he won't run. And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, Let's go to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay? But then they said, Oh, well he announced. So these talking heads, most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they'd say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn't go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they're brilliant. One's brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don't like him. But what happens is they say Well, he'll never file form A. That's basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A. Then they said, Well, he'll never sign his financial statement because maybe he's not as rich as everybody thinks. Then they said, And if he does, he'll ask for many, many delays because you're entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they'll delay it until after the election. I said, No so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn't believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned. I built a great company and the reason, honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that, low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets, Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Avenue, land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over. In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location. And what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said Oh, I can't believe it. Then they said Well, maybe he won't do so well with the polls. And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run. And I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me You know if you run you will win. Don't you? She's very smart. I said, What do you mean? She said, If you don't run, you're never going to poll before. Nobody believes you're going to run. So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren't great before I announced. She said, No, the only way you're going to get a poll number is you've got to announce. Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you're running, it doesn't matter. Nobody believes you're running. So I said, All right. I'm getting these lousy early numbers and I'm saying, I don't know. I don't want to run and find out it doesn't work. I don't want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It's true. It's true. So I said, All right. Let's take it. So we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I'm telling you and you know what I'm talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, Let's go to my wife. Thank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I'll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she's very proud. The only bad news, I can't get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can't speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that's okay. It's an honor to be with you. You know, I've devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven't done what I've done. I've received many, many awards. I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, Don't do it. Don't do it. I walked up Fifth Avenue. I'm looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, No way am I not going to do it. And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had. So, I'm in a different position than the other candidates because I'm the one candidate I don't want any of your money; I want your support but I don't want your money. I'm self funding my campaign. It's been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far. I thought by this time I'd have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it. At first, I was embarassed by that. I said, You know, I think we're going to have spend money just to spend money but it's not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It's not even close. Every single poll, every single state. The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire, the PPP poll, Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right? Most of importantly, favorability, no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That's ultimately the most important. And you know, I've been a tremendous fan and I've been a tremendous contributor. I've given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job. And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind. In fact, I've been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It's loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you. My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they've been great. They have been great. So, Obama is the worst thing that's ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst. And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro Israel, very, I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they're having fundraisers for Obama. I said, What are you doing? And it's almost like they answer me and they say, We don't know. He comes to New York. We don't know. We don't know. I said he's a disaster. I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I'm a negotiator like you folks. We're negotiators. We don't build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million, can you imagine this? A small gas station,$43 million, and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don't sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station. How many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please? But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don't need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It's true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion. They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self inspect. We're going to let them self inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we're all good with contracts don't start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect. And we don't even get our prisoners back. And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don't want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three. Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago. And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I'm saying. It should have been you walk in, by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn't win anything. We didn't win anything. But that should have been with our prisoners, day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don't want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it's going to look good. And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They're going to say, No, we're not giving. And we're going to say, Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you're ready. And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they're calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It's so easy. Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I've ever seen. No, he's the worst negotiator I've ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he's one of the few. He's one of the, biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn't read it. And Obama definitely didn't read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh. But they said, this is hard to believe but this is what they said, a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don't I end up with a, they said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It's really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn't want to complicate, so now, we're going to end up making a new deal probably at some point. I'd tell you this, look I'll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They're going to be back, I guarantee you. They're going to be back. Now, our president doesn't want to use the term, we had another event, which probably was, the one yesterday, probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related, radical Islamic terrorism. And I'll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There's something going on with him that we don't know about. Now, as far as Hillary's concerned, she's going to go with what he wants. She shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn't be allowed to run. She's going to have to follow his line because she's on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his US Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it's very dishonest what's going on with our government. General David Petraeus was given a life changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially, look, I don't want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went, for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did. And Obama, I mean, she can't go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That's the end of it. That's the end of it. So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he's got control of her. I mean, it's just total control. But I'll tell you what, she shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act. And remember this, this is a six year, you have a six year statute of limitations. So she's fighting for her life. If she doesn't become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody? Because what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she's been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it's Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption. She was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole, the world blew up around her. It blew up. 500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn't respond. The truth is she doesn't have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we're talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there. But she responded, yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don't get that. But she responded to a friend, but she doesn't respond to an ambassador that's asking for help. Hundreds, hundreds of requests and she doesn't respond. Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd. The other day I was in Florida, we had 12000 people in Sarasota at 12 pm with the football games going on. 12000 people. The convention center held 5000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speeches. I said, You can't get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech? My people said, No, this is the biggest one. We set a record, a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It's true. Elton John. I'm no longer competing with politicians. I'm competing with the musical talent. One of the great musicians said You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar meaning who doesn't count on music. So it's true, we've had tremendous response. We've had incredible response. I think you know if you look at what's going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls, again I don't want your money therefore you're probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn't want money therefore we can't, even though he's better than all these guys, even though he's going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don't know if that's, but they said I'm the only celebrity. I don't know. I'm not a celebrity. See now I'm a politician. I'm so embarrassed by that term. You know, my how life I've been a business, I've been a developer. I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company. A lot of people said, Oh, he'll never file. This you'll get a kick out of. He'll never run because he'll never want to file various papers. And then he'll never file this and that and then you'd have to sign your life away. The first paper, we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That's the end of it. He did it. Then they said, Well, he'll never sign and he'll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he's not as rich as people think. So I filed my financials, almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, Oh my, it's much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers! If I didn't run, I'd probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It's true. Some of the greatest assets, Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many, Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things And the reason I bring that up is because that's the kind of thinking we need. And I don't bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that's the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don't know the first thing about the word negotiation. I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they're better than Obama and they're better than Kerry and they're better than the foolish people, the foolish people. It's so embarrassing when you see what happens. Sergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl, we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one. And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him. The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, No, he deserted. He was a traitor. And we still made the deal. So we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to renegotiate deals? Some of us will renegotiate deals. I would say about 99,is there anybody that doesn't renegotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to renegotiate, perhaps more than any room than I've ever spoken. Maybe more. It's okay. I've been called on that a couple of times too. But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell, they can have him even if we don't get the five guys back because that's not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They're right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in. So they get their five guys that they've wanted for nine years they've wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that's the way our people negotiate. They're stupid people. Okay? They're stupid people. It's very sad. It's very sad. So I'll just tell you that I'm going to win. I am. I'm going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I'll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here's a nice one, you're number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people, talented people, great people. But I believe I'm going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I've won, and my life has been about winning, and that's what I want to do for the country. And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest. It's like the other day, Ivanka, she's doing so great. Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, Honey, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka? It's amazing. See? Now I'm dealing in trillions. I've never heard of trillions before. You know, with this, we owe $19 trillion. We just signed a budget that's so bad and the Republicans, you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they're going to end Obamacare, which I'm going to do by the way, I'm ending, I'm terminating, it's going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they're going to do this and they're going to do budgets, like I heard the guy before We're going to work in the budget. It's all about that. What happens is they're going to do budgets like we're going to do this and that and I tell this story, then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors. They've never seen anything like it. We've arrived. This is incredible. And then they become mainstream. We'll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote. They don't want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they'd get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they've let us down. That won't happen with me. So, again, you're not going to support me even though you know I'm the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I'll be that. I know why you're not going to support me and you know you're not going to support me because I don't want your money. Isn't it crazy? No, it's true. You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I'd have a damn good chance and I think I'd get more money than anybody else. Do you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions. I would have made, poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It's sad. No, it's sad. I came up with that term, it became so defining. It's like having it on his forehead I am low energy. No, no, it's sad. He raised $125 million, which means he's controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money. That's why you don't want to give me money, okay? But that's okay. You want to control your own politician. That's fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don't worry about it. I understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who's better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It's true. $350000. I didn't receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don't give any, why would I give any more? You don't get a thank you letter. Politicians, remember this, politicians forget, politicians generally aren't competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that's what you're going to end up having. But I would love your support but I don't want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let's take some questions. Okay? Good. I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we'd do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What's happened all over. What's happened in Iowa. It's been really incredible. We've had some amazing results and they continue to come in. Got a little shake up in Iowa. I don't know what's going on. Somebody said Are you going straight to New Hampshire? Now, I love New Hampshire. We've got great numbers. 38 to 12. That's good. But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds. Everybody said and it's very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they'd have like 50 people and they wouldn't need this room. Believe me. But everybody said without question in every poll, this isn't just here, that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don't go anywhere. They're staying. It's true. I see it. I see it. And we've seen it. You know, a couple of times I say Well, that could be the end. Then they do something and I'm 10 points up. It's the craziest thing, right? But we'll take it. But they say the people are with, we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it. The other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don't you think? Leadership. I mean, when leadership is number one, they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot. So you know it's great. I thought I'd talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right? We have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it's always tough when you're on live television all the time. Look, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics? The bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you're on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you're talking about immigration and you're talking about the wall because we're going to have a wall and we're going to stop illegal immigration. But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about. But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it's really about results. Isn't it? It's really about results. And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways. I talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we're losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples. But it's still going to be a certain number of subjects. I talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments. You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. At least with me it's not going to happen. That I can tell you. So I said today you know we'll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we're going to have some fun. We're going to do that. A few things, I want to bring up a few new subjects. So, immigration, we're going to be doing a very strong number. It's killing us. It's killing us. And it's bad for the economy. It's bad for, all of this illegal immigration. And I have to tell you legal, you come in and we're going to have a good time and you're going to be there and you're going to do great, and visas, maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we'll do something, we're not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We're going to make our economy much, much stronger. But we're also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We're going to get jobs. We're going to get jobs. But the illegal immigration, you know, I did this and I made my determination, I took a deep breath. Because I'll tell you what, it takes courage to say I'm going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it. I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again. All of these incredible places that I have. But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you're putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody's done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it. Now at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don't we agree? It's getting ridiculous. Because like tomorrow night we're having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long? Hillary's debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was, oh, it was, you couldn't watch it. You have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he's not going to win. Just so you understand, He's not going to win and neither is she Well, she's being totally protected because in theory she shouldn't even be allowed to run. She's being protected. It's a tough game and it's a nasty game but she's being totally protected. But she's going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O'Malley. So he'll be out quickly, I guess. I don't know what's he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero. And I wouldn't say it against our folks. But they've treated me, some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points. And you know what? I'm not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that's hit me so far has gone down. They've gone down. And they've gone down bigly. And a couple of the ones and zeroes, they're the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they're like desperate people. But they hit. One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don't understand. What does it mean? I assume it's a typo but maybe not. But when you look at the things that are happening with our country, the trade situation with not just China, I talk about China all the time because that's the main abuser, that's the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it,$400 billion a year. And they send stuff over here but we can't send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax. A friend of mine can't get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax. Somebody bought an airplane in China here. Can't get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can't get it over there because the tax is so massive that he's now selling in this country because China won't let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax. I won't even tell you what the tax is. It's so astronomical that I don't even believe them myself. So I'm not going to say it because those guys will say Well, he was wrong. All I can tell you is it's a massive tax. Like you don't buy planes here because if you do, you won't be able to get them back in. And here, we accept all of their products. So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China. We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan. We have a, you know, with all that's going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer, a relatively small ship, over there, I don't know if I'd want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they're being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen. But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they're smarter, sharper, more cunning. The leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They're taking so many of our companies. Even Nabisco, my Oreos, they're taking Nabisco. Right? I'm never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don't want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back. But I'm not happy. They're leaving Chicago and they're moving their big plant to Mexico. So when you see this happening, we have to stop it. And I'm not going to beat around the bush and Oh, let's talk and let's be nice and let's say, Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody. We can, I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm not perfect. Nobody's perfect Now, nobody's perfect. But I'll tell you when it comes to that stuff I'm really, there's nobody better. Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He's one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he's not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they're doing. He understand. You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on. Corporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2 trillion overseas right now. They can't get it in. And everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They've agreed for years. They can't make a deal because they have no leader. It's not like Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else. Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I'm friendly with all of them. I'm friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody. You know, everybody says Oh, you won't be a unifier. I'll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier? But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything's going to be great. Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn't have done it. But when you look at what's happening with corporations and the highest tax, we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country, but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can't get their money back. And the reason is bureaucracy. It's very hard. And also big reason the tax is too high. They don't want to bring $1 million back and pay $300000 or $350000 tax. They'd rather leave it over there. And if they bring it back, they'll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen. I happen to believe it's more than $2 trillion. But here's the thing and I use it because it's so incredible. Here's the thing. It's not controversial. It's not like you have the Republicans here and you have, everybody agrees. They've agreed you know that for 2, 3 years. They can't make a deal. And now what's happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States, two reasons, lower taxes but also to get their money. They've got billions of dollars overseas. They're leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax. And you're talking about one company I know of, I don't know how much they've written about it, but you're talking about 6000 jobs just one company. You're talking about potentially thousands of companies. And I say it, in the old days, they'd leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they'd move to Texas or they'd leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they'd move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That's what's happened. In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it's a different world out there. And there's no loyalty. They're paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they'd like to move back to these countries. They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don't mind. They don't have loyalty to the United States. So my plan, my tax plan, is something I'm very proud of. We're going to solve corporate inversion. I'll tell you what, we will have that money back, if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don't even know about it. It's not their wheelhouse. Okay? It's not their thing. It's not their thing. Their thing is getting reelected. That's what they're good at. They get reelected. And they make promises and they're all talk and they're no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It's always the same. So we have so many different things and what I've done with our tax plan, which something I'm very proud of, we've brought it down to a few groups. Because right now, you have to go out, people who aren't doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They'll pay $500, $1000 because it's so complicated. And we're going to make it nice and simple. And we're getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we're getting rid of it. They don't love me so much anymore. But I don't care. And we're getting rid of a lot of things. So we're going to have a nice simple tax return. Somebody said Oh, why isn't everybody paying? You know, 40%,a big percentage, will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly. They said, well, I won't use the candidates' name because I don't want to insult any candidate when they can't defend themselves. They said We want everybody to pay at least something. And I said, I agree. Here's the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you're talking about millions and millions of returns. You're talking about building the IRS even bigger and it's a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you're talking about is far less than the administrative costs. So I said, I agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it's too much. Most of these people aren't paying anyway. What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan. I was in Los Angeles. Ships, the biggest ships you've ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing. The balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes. See, what our people don't know and only somebody that wrote The Art of the Deal or does this stuff. It's natural. It's like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he's just better. And you have athletes, very few, but there are some people that have a certain ability. A lot of people don't even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China. You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1,think of this, trillion. $1 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It's a magic act. For them not for us. For us it's a horror show. It's going to end. It's going to end. And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators, I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I'll be honest with you. I don't care. Do you care if they're horrible people? Who cares? Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he's a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he's built a fortune. He doesn't want money. He doesn't want to say, Oh, give me $200000 a year in government money. He wants to do it. He's proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it's so easy for him. For instance, if I say Carl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we're losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair. I don't have to give him a big speech. I don't have to give him a big speech. I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it's going to be our benefit. But think of it, if we're losing that kind of money, that imbalance. It's an imbalance. Some people will say That's not really a loss. It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that's a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn't sleep. If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right? But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you're talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen. And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they'll have 75% and maybe they'll like them better. Maybe they'll be better. And they'll be manufactured here. Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television, other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan. But South Korea, LG, Samsung. I don't get bids from American. I'd love to. I'd love to. George Will said there's a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I'd like to have a good name too by the way. It's important. You know, when somebody's paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it's nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree? Well, it's a company in South Carolina but they don't make them there; they assemble them. They'll order parts that come in and they'll assemble them. But much different. But I'd love it if we made them. But you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don't talk about him. We made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst. These are the people that represent, these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, You shouldn't say stupid. It's not nice. But it's true. They're stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don't know is there something going on that we don't know about? Think of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We've given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don't have to develop, I was telling somebody they don't have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it. What the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they're going into Syria. They got so much money. They're a terrorist state. They're going into all of these different places. We're fighting them in Yemen and yet we're making a deal with them. So why don't you say Hey, Yemen out? Our prisoners, I want them back. I want them back. I don't want them over there. I want them back. And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I'm the right messenger. You know, I've gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It's terrible. Right? Because I can't be so nice and say We can all do a wonderful job. People can't do those kind of stuff. For instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we're going to build a wall. It's going to be a real wall. We're going to have people come through and they're going to come through legally. Or they're going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it. And we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don't want to say no. But we have at least 11 million, you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we've been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be $50 million But we have to get them out. We have to, look, it's harsh. Dwight Eisenhower, we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right? I go remember he got elected,I like Ike. How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we're going to find ourselves a Patton and we're going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We're going to find ourselves a Patton. But we're going to find a Patton and we're going to find a MacArthur. And I'm really good at that. We're going to find great people. And I've told this story where I watched these generals go on television, they shouldn't be on television. They shouldn't be talking. You know? They shouldn't be talking. They should be doing. And they asked a certain general, I'm not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here's general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what's he doing on television? And he's saying Well, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out. By the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said Take the oil? Always take the oil! They're being funded by the oil that I said take. I don't want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn't do it. We shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn't have been there. We totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it. But we were there. Then Obama announces because he's so predictable We are leaving on a certain date in a year. Right? I couldn't believe. I was sitting there thinking Did he really say that? He said We will have all troops out by a certain date. Right? Did he say that? I said No, no, tell me please. Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I'll be the best in the military because they say I, you know, I always say I'll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that. But you know what I'll be? I'll be the great at the military. I'll be so good. And I'll know when, and I'll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody's going to mess around. We're never going to have to use it. We're never going to have to use it. And I'm going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they're our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I'm going to take care of our vets. So go back. So the world is unpredictable. I made a business deal a year ago. And the guy, oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That's my own problem. I guess. But to me it's like a painting when you could do something like that. So I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don't call this guy. They ended up calling this guy What do you think about Trump? And he said but in a respectful way, he said He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don't know what the hell he was going to do. That's a positive. That's a positive. I mean, if you're a poker player and you're predictable, you're not going home with much money. Okay? But it was really, I said, That's not nice what he said. First, I said That's not nice. I'm unpredictable. Then I said, Wait a minute. He meant that as a compliment. And I called him. I said, What did you mean by that? He said I think that's the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles. So with Obama, when he announces that we're leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn't have been there but once you announced the bad guys, you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, Hey, what do we have to get killed for? I mean, these people don't mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said If we don't have to, let's not. So they moved back. And they said, Hey, they're leaving in, What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. We will have all troops out. I'm a great president. So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, Oh, you're leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let's go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he'll change his mind and stay. So let's let him think he has this great victory with the surge. Right? The surge worked! What happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, Let's wait. Now we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That's what happened. That was the surge. Everybody talk so much,Oh, the surge was so great. The surge was great because everybody knew, they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush. I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, Let's get them out. Everybody wanted to leave. Now, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won't even say. People say, Mr. Trump, what's your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where? I say You know, I don't want to talk, I have a real chance of winning. I don't want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don't really want to tell you. I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let's face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it's got flaws. But you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say, although some people, I see it here, some people say We love that. We love that. But when I give that answer, some people say Oh, Trump doesn't know. He doesn't know. He didn't give an answer as to exactly what he's going to do. Exactly what he's going to do. And I know exactly what I'm going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, You know, here's the problem. If I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win. They're going to say Trump wouldn't give us the answer. They don't know it's unpredictability. They don't know it's strategy. And I said for a period of time like a month, I said I don't want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I've been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we're doing well. Iowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job. First of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that. And I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don't know what I did. But I am a great Christian. I'm a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date, I won't tell you what date it was because possibly you'd think I'm younger than that. But she didn't want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her. So cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, You know, By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition? Do you think these guys, I'm not going to say Carson, I'm not going to say Rubio, who really is way down, I mean, I am second. It's not like it's terrible. But I don't like being second. Second is terrible to me. But do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they'd come into your office. I've made many deals with China. I've had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There's no Hello. How are you? It's a wonderful day. They come in,We want deal. There's no games. I do this for a living. I'm really good at it, folks. Really good. And you know, when you talk about energy, I'll tell you one thing, everybody agrees, oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I'm going to make the best deal for you folks. I'll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You're going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We're going to have numbers are going to be so good. I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning. We don't win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever? We lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody. We lose with trade. When are we going to come back and say, We beat China on a deal? When are we going to come back, We beat Japan? Do you know that everybody said Oh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1 trillion and they send all those cars. They have no power. If we ever say, Listen, if you're not going to treat us fairly, we don't want your cars anymore, they'd go out of business, folks, they're gone. Same thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, Oh wow, we can get away with this and it's going to make it impossible. Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they're not getting stuff out because everybody, Japan and China in particular, is devaluing their currency. That's their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we're making doesn't even cover it. That's their number one weapon and the trade that we're making doesn't cover it. So I only say this and you know what? People might say It's terrible. He's a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I'm going to vote for him anyways. Okay, that's fine. I'm actually a nice person. I always say this, nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I'm running against. They're wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares? I was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn't even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It's not their thing. And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we're being eaten alive. That's why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren't working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It's not 5%. That was done for politicians so they'd look good. It's not 5%. How can you have 5% when you have 100 million people? You look for a job. If you're a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right therebut if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can't get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It's the most ridiculous thing. We have a tremendous, tens of millions of people in that position. They can't find jobs. They're good people. They want to work. They can't. But it's not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good. So let me just before we talk some questions, I'm going to talk about something I've never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It's called Super PACs. It's one of the great scams of all time. It's one of the great scams. So we sent out, I think I had, and it's not me. People set them up. And I don't know. Maybe they're setting up for my benefit. Let's take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don't talk to him. I don't do anything. I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don't even know. They're all over the place. Trump, Trump, one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. They have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don't know. And we aren't supposed to call them or anything. Okay. So, we wrote a letter, a legal letter, to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don't want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that's having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he's going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not. So we sent them a, it's a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It's a disgrace that we have. A disgrace. And I'll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he's paying a lot of money and that's not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they're paying, now think of it, who pays, the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I'm telling you it may be off but you all know it's a lot. I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune. I know in Romney's campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It's better than being a real estate broker. For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It's a scam. It's a scam. Now, in Ben's case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses. In the case of Jeb Bush, you're not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They're not supposed to be coordination. They're not supposed to be talking. They're right next to each other. And that's nothing compared to what some are doing. It's a scam and it should be stopped. And it's unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money. And what happened and I haven't talked about this before but I'm seeing what's going on. It's horrible what's going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall. And this is a wall too. Won't be as good as the one I'm going to build but it's a wall. But it was a wall and they didn't deal. I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I'm sure they never talk. I'm sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I'd say 100%. I'd say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever. They're not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that's the way it works. And in some cases, I hear in Ben's case, I hear in other cases, they're literally running. I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they're all doing. That's why he's out of the race because he couldn't figure it out. The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They're all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don't want to get advertisements. We don't want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don't even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They'll probably if they actually raised money for me, they'll say What a horrible thing he just said. I think we're going to support somebody else. They could do that. But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing. I feel it's very unfair. I feel it's a very unfair situation. Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything. But what are they doing with this whole thing? And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest. But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates, some more than others. Some are unbelievable. And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You'll be amazed. I mean, it's so little. Bush, it's the same thing. And I'll go over, there are other names. I know every one of them. But it's a horrible thing that's taking place. And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they're not even going through the motions. They're not even going through. And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, I want an endorsement. I don't know if they'll give me an endorsement. I'll tell you if they don't they're not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere, I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it. When we can. By the way, it's a great company. It's a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don't have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can. But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it's crooked stuff. It's crooked stuff. And it's got to stop. And it's very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you're supposed to do it, including me. I think I'm the only one that's self funding. I'm the only one putting up my own money, other than, I know it's precious, people write in to or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7, $50, $100. I don't want their money. But if you send it back it's totally insulting. I mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters,Mr. Trump, I can't afford much and I know you don't need it but I'm sending $50 because that's so important what you're saying about the country. It's beautiful. I mean, I've seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there's no letter I can write that's not going to be insulting to those people, really. Dear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don't need your money and thanks a lot but we're going to do it ourselves. If I got that back, I'd say Who the hell does he think he is? So we take that and it's something that I think is important. So I always preface it by saying I don't consider that funding but I'm self funding my campaign and I'm getting ready to put up millions, millions. And something I'm very proud of that I think it's great and it's you know really great, it hasn't gotten very much publicity, hasn't gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don't know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around. But I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I'm number one. Now, until Iowa came along, I said every poll, and then Iowa, what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know? I'm telling you. They said, Why don't you skip Iowa? They told me that. Everybody said Skip Iowa. All of the political geniuses. A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He's actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won't say that. But he is. He's a great reporter. And he said, Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you'd go to South Carolina where I'm leading by massive, yeah, you've got to see the rallies there. They're incredible. But you'd go to New Hampshire. You'd go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC. I said I can't do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we're going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it. And I don't want to skip Iowa. I think we're going to do well. I think we're going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I'm going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I'm the real deal. So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that. So could we do, and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I'm going to win, I'm telling you we're going to win New Hampshire, and we're going to win South Carolina. A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll. But we're going to go on and we're going to win. We're going to win. And actually, one of the pundits, because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said He'll never run. He's not going to run. They're still trying to recover. But one of the very smart one says If Trump wins Iowa, it's over. It's interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great. And I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that's the end of that. But I want to tell you, will you, I refuse to say Get your asses in gear. I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don't want to use anything that's even a little bit off. So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory? And if I win Iowa, we're going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we're going to have such a great military and we're going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that's a nightmare. So, I'm sticking with you people. I'm going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I'm going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it's so important. And you know, it's about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last, right? So, I love you all. I mean, we're having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I'm going to stay here. We're going to work really hard. When I heard the poll today, they said What are you going to do? I said, I'm going to work harder in Iowa. I'm not leaving Iowa. I'm not leaving Iowa. Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you. Okay, let's do a couple of questions. Right? Come on. So, we're going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. It's a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn't seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we've got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven't seen in a long time. We're going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you're single and earn less than $25000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50000,so, very important. If you're single and earn less than $25000 or married and jointly earn less than $50000, you'll not pay any income tax, nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It's a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich, in other words, it's going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true, while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I've been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business, now, so important, because it's all about business. It's all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can't work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount,10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it's called corporate inversion. It's a huge subject. I've been watching politicians now for years, all talk, no action politicians. I've been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back. The number is probably $2 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back, Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can't make a deal. They don't know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn't make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They're leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They're going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons, the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can't bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It's called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can't bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We've been doing this for a year and a half. We can't get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that's what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something, and I've been watching it for a long time, everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes, many of them actually, and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don't make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you, we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we're going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you'll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It's graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they'll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we'll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what's going on in this country. If you look at what we're doing and the money we're spending. I read where a washer, you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer, to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there. And there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money. We will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved. We're reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. We won't be losing anything other than we'll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. So, this is a plan that's simple, that's a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We've already had some very good reviews. I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say Why hasn't this been done before? And this is my wheelhouse. That's what I do well. The economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won't say that. So, if anybody has, thank you. That's amazing. That's some of the press was actually clapping. I've never saw, I don't think I've ever seen that before. All right. Why don't we take some questions from the press? We're doing really well. Iowa's been amazing. It's been amazing. We're doing so well and I love this place and I'm back here all the time and I'm going to be here a lot in January. You're going to be so sick of me. You'll probably say, We can't give the caucus, just forget it. We can't stand the guy any more. No, you're going to like me and we're going to be back and we're going to do a great job for you. Most importantly, we're going to get to that office and we're going to do the right thing. We're going to do the right thing. So, a few things. A lot so much has happened. You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we're just doing so great with the border security. We're going to build a wall. Mexico's going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we're going to have security. And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they're going to come into the country they're going to be legal, they're coming in legally, and that's the way. That's the way. And it affects Iowa so much. So we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It's going to be repealed. It's going to be replaced. I don't know if you've been seeing what's happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It's dying of its own weight. And by 2017, meaning he'll be playing golf and I'll be working very hard. But 2017 instead you're not getting the people signed up. There's been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it. Obamacare's dead but we'll terminate it quicker than that. And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better. Premiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you're close to death, you'll never going to get to use. And even then I don't think you're going to get to use it really. So, we're going to take care of that. And by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really we have the ethanol where are the ethanol people? Right? I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it's so important. And it's another form of let's stay away from OPEC and let's stay away from that Middle East stuff. It's so important Actually what I don't understand because the one guy that's doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he's a nice guy. I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say. I was going to do one really wild but he agrees. But with the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way because he's right now for the oil. But I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He's got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money. But I'm with you. I'm with everybody. Look, I'm self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they're representing countries that are ripping off the country, they're representing companies that are ripping off our country. All I do is I'm going to be working for you folks. We're going to do this thing together. We're going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important. So when we first started, I talked about China how they're ripping us and Japan and Mexico. Mexico both at the border and in trade. They're taking so many of our companies. Nabisco's moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee a great state they took it away at the last moment. I'm not going to let that stuff. We're going to do what we have to do, okay? But I talked about that and I talk about it a lot. The fact is that about 2 weeks ago with Paris, I'm speaking a little bit differently now. Believe me, I can take care of China in my back pocket. That's easy for me. That's what I do. And we have all the cards. A lot of people don't know. You know, these politicians they don't understand we have the cards. You know, with China, our people pay tax. They pay no tax. It's not supposed to be that way. They call it a tariff because it sounds better. But we'll take care of that. We'll take care of all of that. What happened is with Paris, there's a different mindset. And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me. Now, maybe it had to do who knows why? Who knows? But my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there's something that I do that's proper but controversial, they'd say Oh, now he's gone. That's it. That's the end. I won't go over all of the different things because maybe you'll change your minds. But they'd say, That's it. It's over. And then they'd come in, Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week. I said, They did? Because I have to do what's right. I have to do what's right. And you know what? If I don't make it, I don't make it. I have a good life. We all hopefully have a good life. I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. They love me. I think. I hope. I think. But I have a great family and I built a great business. There's such spirit There's such spirit no matter where I go. You know, I go to Dallas. We have 20000. 35000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be for like a record. It is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I'm doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness. Sort of interesting. You know, the slogan is Make America Great Again and I'm adding Make America Great Again and Safe Again because we don't feel safe anymore. And the problem we have now that we've never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It's the power. It's the tremendous power. You know, 100 years ago, I would have said Let's not go. I said Don't go there anyway. And I said it strongly Don't go. You're going to destabilize the Middle East. But the fact is right now, we're going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates. And the press look at all those cameras going all live, all you know, nobody else has cameras like this. They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. Look at this. And don't worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That's why I'm walking around. I figured I'll walk around maybe they'll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them Pan the crowd, they never do. I had a crowd 7000 people last week. More. 7000 people and in a confined space. They had 3000 people outside that couldn't get in. My wife says, Darling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there? I said What? She said, Well, they never leave your face. They keep it purposely. But I'll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can't move them, right? But every time there's a protester Well, I'm protesting and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It's true. It's true. It's true. No, I used to think they couldn't move. You know, maybe there's something with the crazy computers. You know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You'd sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes. Well, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn't think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons. And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn't believe possible. So, they're very dishonest people. What can I say? Not all of them but most of them. I'll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. The Des Moines Register is the worst. They are the worst. The worst. No, they're very dishonest. You have some reporter named Jacobs. She is the worst. She will write so it's such misrepresentation. And so I don't care. I mean, who cares? So I'm saying it right in their backyard. They're failing anyway. They probably won't be in business in two years. I think they're losing a fortune. I think. You know, it's funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly. I'm only doing this so they don't sue me but I don't mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don't have enough money to sue me. That's the good thing. But I believe and I may be wrong in fact, I'll say I'm sure I'm wrong but it's my opinion that they don't do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. I'll explain it You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. Oh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one. Now, I don't know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register? But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don't know why. But we had a great poll come in CNN last couple of days where we're leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa. And then we have another coming where we're doing well. But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it's coming out sometime. I'll just tell you, watch Trump disappears! I think we're going to do so well. I think we're actually going to even do better. You know, we're leading in most of the poll. We're leading in every poll. Except Iowa there was one poll there was one poll, Monmouth I'd never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don't like Monmouth. You know why I don't like it? Because they always treat me badly also. But I only like polls that treat me well. But we're doing so well. Nationwide, we're leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia 44%. 44%. Think of that. That's 44% with 15 people. I'd take 44% if we had three people. I don't think I'd take it if we had two people but I think I'd take if we had three. But 44%. CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we're at 35% to a small number. We're killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here. Again, I'm sure when Des Moines comes out it'll be a negative because I don't believe that poll. But we are going to win. And I'll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, Oh, let's not do I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham. Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out I don't know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there's nobody, nobody that I've ever seen Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody's gone to his crusades, they were incredible. But so I think we're going to do we're doing really well with the evangelicals And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It's true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. I think we're going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We're doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party. And we're doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We're doing great with everybody. And so it's very important for me to win Iowa. Now, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, Oh, I don't care about Iowa. I don't care. But I do care. I do care so much about it. That's why we're here all the time. And then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, The people of Iowa can't be that stupid or the people of the country can't. I'm trying to make a point, right? So I said, The people of the country can't be that stupid. Well, they cut the country out so it's referring to Iowa. I love you people. Remember that. Remember that. I was talking about something, and I won't even mention what I'm talking about because the guy I'm talking about and was actually a very good guy. But I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we'd run the table. I really do. I think we'd run the table. We'd go right through. Because we're leading big in New Hampshire every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It's the weirdest deal I've ever seen. And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, Are you sure about that? Nobody ever called us. They can't believe it. And we can get into that but it's irrelevant. But we're leading New Hampshire big. We're leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We're leading Nevada. We're leading in Texas. We're leading everywhere. We're leading big in Florida. Now, you have Rubio nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you've got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you've got to go and vote. You can't be the number one person that doesn't vote in the Senate. You've got to say, Hey, I'm a young guy. I want to go and vote. You should stay there a little longer. He's a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record. But I don't know. How's he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He's not doing well. How's Rubio doing? Not good. I mean, it seems like a two person race right now and it's an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it's very important. So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we'd just go through. I think we'll win virtually every state in the Union and it's over quickly. Over quickly. What about the Republican establishment? The establishment's got a problem, you know. It's sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they'll go into the hometown of a guy they're fighting and they'll say, You know, we'd never want to get a decision. We go for the knockout. The knockout is the knockout. Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it's a decision and they say, Uh, we're in a problem and they'd lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely knock out. So, if we win Iowa, I think we're going to win everything after that. So I think it's going to show how important Iowa is. I'll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I'll pledge it, okay? I don't think I've ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa's staying right where it is in the chain. It's not moving. You know, there's a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. Folks, I win it's not happening, okay? You're staying right here because it's great. It's great. You've been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way. Let's put them in. Because Medicare does work. With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. We're going to take care of that. Okay? But we're not going to cut your Social Security and we're not cutting your Medicare. We're going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We're going to become a wealthy country again. And we're going to be able to save your Social Security. I can't believe this number but I read it over who is the man that told me the number over 6 million people I can't believe it are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They're dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million now, we know there's not 6 million, there may be one. But there's not 6 million. Anybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand. But so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that's the beginning. So there's tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. What we're going to do is we're going to save Medicare. We're going to save Social Security. We're not going to raise the age or we're not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They're all talking about doing it, and you don't have to. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make our economy incredible again. My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it's gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups. But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated. And when that happens, you're going to see an economy that takes off. We're going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we're going to get rid of it you know, we're at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right. You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn't even a word anybody knew and now it's like routine. So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We're going to bring the economy back. We're going to make ourselves rich again. A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you. I love you. But it's very crude when you say you're going to make our country rich again. I said, I know it's crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can't make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can't let everybody in the world rip us off. Remember, we built China. The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China. You go there, they have bridges all over the they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge. Maybe I shouldn't mention that particular bridge. But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge. Only a few people got that one; that's okay. But they have bridges going up. We have rebuilt China. They've taken our jobs. They've taken our base. They've taken our manufacturing all over the place. They've taken our money. They've taken our money. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen. I know the great business people. We have the greatest business people in the world. Guys like Carl Icahn. He calls me, Donald, I want to help. I want to help. The smartest people call. We're not going to use the special interest guy a donor. We use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. Because again, I'm the only one that's self funding my campaign. Everybody else isn't. These guys when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want. That's not going to happen with me. So, Social Security we're saving it. Medicare we're saving it. We're going to make our country rich. Okay? Thank you, sweetheart. Yeah, it's called the statute of limitations, right? And you know it's a six year year statute. Maybe five but it's probably six. But it's a six year statute. Yeah, you have to look at it. Look, Hillary Clinton you know this story. It's a crime. She committed a crime. Now, perhaps perhaps somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps we'll have some really good Attorney General that's going to say Well, you know. Look, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion. Now, she shouldn't be allowed to run. She's being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they're going to find anything. But they've already found it. I mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, Yes, she violated section so and so. Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws. You mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing. So I think she's going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she'll be allowed to run. She's being protected by the Democrats. She's being protected by the President. And that's why why do you think she's going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything. I don't even honestly in all fairness to her, I don't think she believes it. But I think she's afraid he's going to say, Listen, I don't like her anymore. Go take care of her. I'm going to get somebody else. I'm telling you. So, the question is statute of limitations. It's a five year statute of limitations. She's got a problem. She's got a problem. In one way, she's running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that's the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem. Well, I said right at the beginning. We're going to build a wall that's going to be a real wall. That's going to be a real wall. It's not going to be you see that ceiling? That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. And we can build it and we can build it right. And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. It's got to be beautiful because someday they're going to name it the Trump Wall. I know that. It's going to happen. Going to happen. And it's going to work. And walls do work. You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn't get environmental impact statements. That's just shows you. China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They're not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They're not supposed to be doing that. And you could get them to stop just by saying We're not doing business with you anymore. Their whole economy would you don't have to go to war. It's economics. The whole country would collapse in two seconds. Believe me. We have such power and we don't know it. But they're building massive now, they had little islands. They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they're using Komatsu from Japan They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who's Chinese from China very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? I said jokingly How long did it take them to do these massive islands they're building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements? He laughed. He said, What are you kidding me? Nothing. They say We will build there. About two seconds later, you have escavators digging. So we had a problem with environmental look, I've won many environmental awards. I'm a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I'm a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I've gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I've won many, many awards. But when you look at how we're impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn't get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn't get an environmental impact statement. Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don't know. But they actually had people a lot of people people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn't get it done. You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I've been saying that for three years. Now finally they started after Paris they started bombing the oil. I've been saying it for years. You know one of the reasons we didn't bomb the oil? Obama didn't want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn't want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today. I'm telling you, folks, we're being led by stupid people. We're being led by stupid people. I've been saying not really bomb I've been saying take the oil. I didn't want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said Look, we shouldn't have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way. First of all, we have a president who told them a date. We're going to leave on such and such a date. What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, Wow, because don't believe it. They don't want to be killed. Okay? They don't want to be killed. So the enemy said They're going to leave on a certain date? So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It's a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq. So anyway, I couldn't believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces We are sending 50 soldiers. Okay, first of all, he thinks it's a good press announcement. It's not. 50 soldiers that's not a lot even though they're the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart. Why does he have to say that for? Why can't he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can't he just do that? Why can't he do that? Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don't even know that but everybody is looking for them and that's the way it is. We have people that don't know what they're doing. We used to have General MacArthur Douglas MacArthur General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people. Today, we have generals that go on talk shows I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said and this was serious and he's a good man. They're good men. But you've got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we've been in in decades. And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us. And he said we are in the worst shape we've been in many, many decades. Now, number one, he shouldn't be saying that because you're telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn't be saying it. We shouldn't be saying it. I mean, even if it's true, you don't say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite. One thing I'm going to do I'll tell you, I'm going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody is going to mess with us. You know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing you can do. Everyone is toying with us right now. It's the cheapest thing you can do. The absolute cheapest thing you can do. We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we've been. We have people that knows what's going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on. They saw pipe bombs sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on. When you saw the World Trade Center go, people were putting to planes that were friends, families, girlfriends, and they were put into the planes, and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with families. And frankly that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives but they do care, believe it or not, about their families lives. It's a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I've heard about Simon and Schuster's being a fabulous, I was going to say the Rolls Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You've given us such tremendous support. And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It's been an incredible experience. We wrote a book and the title, Crippled America, is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we've been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. And America is crippled. We owe $17 trillion and now $18 trillion and now it's actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. We have a military that doesn't have proper instruction from leadership. We don't know what we're doing. We're losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they're beating us in trade. And we can't go on like this any longer. It's impossible to go on like this any longer. I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that's not the way it's going to work anymore. So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it's going to be very instructional, very important. To me, it was instructional. When I did The Art of the Deal, I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book The Art of the Deal and the other books we've done. So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what's going on right now. It's a moment of time. And we got it done. And David did a fantastic job. And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in. But we see by the lines, the lines go down to Park Avenue. They've been forming since last night and I'm going to be signing books starting at 12 pm We're doing a couple of interviews and then we're signing books starting at 12 pm and that'll be very exciting for me. But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don't know how they're doing this but they do it. They find a way. Well, I think it's a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I'm leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I'm leading big. A poll just came out in Florida where I'm leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. And I think you know look we're doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we're beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we're beating, they call it the establishment. It's called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. But I don't know. I don't know how his book is doing. Well, I think my book is very hard hitting. His is a different kind of book and he's a different kind of a person. My book is very hard hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it's selling like hotcakes. So we'll see. We're very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I'm different from all of the other candidates. Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we're losing with China, that's going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we're short on with Japan. The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that's right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. So I mean, much different than, you're look at Marco Rubio, very, very weak on illegal immigration. You look at Ben and he's very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can't get rid of Medicare. It'd be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don't know how he stays here. No, I think that really Marco is overrated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn't been able to, Marco doesn't show up to the United States Senate. He's representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I'm way up in Florida over everybody. But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn't show up for the people of Florida, and I don't think he should be doing that. Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush's side and ultimately I think Marco's going to be hurt very badly. And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he's coming from, I think people are going to say, Whoa, we didn't know that. But look at Marco's stance on illegal immigration. It's really trouble for him. I don't see how he can win. Marco Rubio's personal finances are discredited. All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I'll tell you what, I love Florida. I'm in Florida all the time. And for years, I've been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that. But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I've heard about it for years. You'll have to find out. Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his, you know, he certainly lives above his means. There's no question about that. I'll tell you what. On the debates, it's very interesting. Because I don't really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let's get going. Because I don't really care that much. But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect, many of them, not all of them, but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn't asked one tough question. They didn't talk about her foundation. They didn't talk about any of the problems. They didn't talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign. First of all, people aren't going to his rallies anymore. He's finished. So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she'll easily be the candidate. But I will say this: She only got softballs. That's all she got. And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn't the same way. With that being said, I don't really care. Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He's a disaster. And he was, it was such as horribly put question and so obvious. And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it. And all we want to do is to be treated fairly. But with me, I don't care that much. Just give me a podium. What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else. You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn't even want to broadcast it because nobody watched. Okay? Nobody wanted to watch. Now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people. I mean, give me a break. So somebody said, How did they get there? And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well, much better than the political press, they said solely for one reason, it was Trump. I'll take the credit. But I'll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates, enormous profits, by the way beyond anything they've ever envisioned. CNN was going to get $2000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250000. So they went from $2000 to $250000 for a 30 second ad. The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That's what I want. I'm giving them away. I'm giving the profits of my book, I'm giving them away to a lot of different, including the vets. I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women. This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn't see that in the construction trades. I mean, it was totally unique. I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many, a proportion that's close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money, in many cases more than men doing the same job. So women have always appreciated that about me. I've been in terms of employment really a standout and I've been honored for doing so well with women. What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate? I don't know. But he didn't say it well. I like Telemundo by the way. I like it better than Univision. I'm suing Univision for $500 million. Because the country is doing so poorly. It's a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly. That's good. They're going to have some demonstrations. Oh, good because it'll get even higher ratings if they do that. I think it's fine. I think they should demonstrate. Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of the highest rated shows ever. And they're very excited about it. And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics. You've treated me actually very fairly. Won the poll recently in Nevada. Won other polls. And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody. So I have a great relationship with the Hispanics. I have working for me thousands right now, thousands of Hispanics. I've had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me. I'm a job machine. I'm a job machine. And one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close. I'm two, three, and you see that, two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else. And you'd almost say like it's about the jobs, it's about the economy. Then how's anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness? But I've had a great relationship with the workers. I've had a great relationship with jobs. And I've had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics. And I predict that I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. I think I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. I predict, yeah, I think I'm going to get the nomination and I will win the White House. I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad. That's the question I like. How am I preparing for my SNL? Well, I'm meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while. Afterwards, we're going to sign, I guess got thousands of people on line but we're going to sign and then later on this evening I'm meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and we'll start the preparation. We'll pick our skits. Am I nervous? Not too nervous. Not too nervous. But we're going to do a good job and we're going have a fantastic show. We're all going to have a lot of fun. My Jeb impression? No, I don't want to do that. I don't like showing a person sleeping at the podium. Tom is asking Can Jeb make a comeback? I think it's going to be very hard. Very hard. Not about money. I just think, you know, I came up with the energy. And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track. You can't do that when you don't have that. I think Marco is highly overrated. Highly overrated. He doesn't have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things. Jeb, he lacks the quality that you need. We're talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off. You need a very strong person with tremendous energy. Thank you very much folks, I'll take the job. But and it's so important. And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy. We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President. We have a president right now that doesn't have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he's been a horrible president. We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect. And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion. Well, we just went over that. Honestly, we just went over that. And it's only going to make it harder. You're going to see what we're going to do. You're going to see. But the whole thing with anchor babies, I turned out to be right. A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here. Now, we're responsible for that person for the next 85 years. I don't think so. And by the way, I was right, they were wrong. The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that. And if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country. You would be laughed out of the country so fast. So, that turned out, I was 100% right. We'll have to worry about that. We're going to take care of it, and it's going to be done in a very humane way. But we're going to bring back our country and we're going to have a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall and you know why they're going to pay? And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people. Phenomenal. And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands, by the thousands. Phenomenal relationships. But let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance, $45 billion last year. Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars. They will pay for the wall. And it will be very interesting. And you know what? People are going to come into this country but they're going to come in legally. A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration. Well, walls work. All you have to do is ask Israel. Walls work if it's properly constructed. Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace, all talk, no action politicians, they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it. Walls work. All you have to do is go and see Israel. They will tell you that walls work. We need pomp and circumstance. Our country has no spirit. Our country has no gravitas. Our country doesn't feel good about itself. And the primary reason is we have no victories. I mean, where have we had a victory? Where have we had a victory in trade? Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where we've given them $150 billion and we lose everything. We lose everything. It's a laughing stock. Worst deal. Worst contract I've ever seen drawn. We have no victories. And I do write about it. We need some pomp and circumstance. We need spirit. We need a cheerleader. I thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. He's not. He's been a great divider for the country. He's been one of the great dividers of all time. I'm not saying dress. It has nothing to do with dress. It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive. He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened. I'll go anyway they want. I don't care too much about the debates. Look, I'm the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway. Nobody else gets the really nasty questions. In a certain way, maybe they're defending me although I will tell you they're not doing it for that reason. I think it's irrelevant. I just, I like the debates. I've had the debates. I've done well in the debates. As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates. Now, I don't know if I did or not but I certainly didn't do badly. But every single poll says, even CNBC's poll said I won the debate. So I like the debates. I think they're good for me. But we have to be treated a little bit fairly. As an example, Hillary Clinton, no tough questions. I mean, why didn't they ask about Bill? Why didn't they ask about all of the different things. No tough questions. Now, that was staged by the Democrats. And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it. Well, we're going to stage something properly also. But as far as I'm concerned, I really don't care that much. I just want a debate. I think debating is a good thing. It's healthy. Gets everything into the open. But you don't want people like Harwood that read a question, blah, blah, blah, that he wrote, that he carefully wrote. He thought he was such, his career, in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened. He could ask about anything you want. I mean, you have to ask about anything you want. Hillary had only softballs. All night long. It was like this, Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park. Are you from Russia? All right. I think our relationship with Russia will be very good. Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago. Right? Putin. And they have one of the highest ratings they've had in a long time. So I'm going to give him total credit. But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia. Now, maybe we won't. But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia. I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin. Well, I think there are a lot of economic issues. We didn't talk about trade. We didn't talk about devaluations. Right? We didn't talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don't even know what it means. But we didn't talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country, massive companies, because they can't get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere. So they're leaving and they're taking their jobs with them. The corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about. These were all things that weren't talked about at the debate. Instead, they talked about fantasy football. I mean, it was a big question, fantasy football. I'm saying what about corporate inversions? $2 trillion at least. I think it's probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can't get the money back to invest in this country. So they don't talk about corporate inversions at the debates. They talk about fantasy football. Those are the few. I was against the war in Iraq. You know, it was very early on. I'll give it to you. Yeah, I have it upstairs Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn't care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That's exactly what's happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I've felt that for a long time. Do I think that it's time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero, in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because that's less than zero. I assume that's not happening. Do I think it's time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out? Yes. There are too many people. Well, I don't want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers. Look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they're at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out. Like, you know, look at me. I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida. 37%? Georgia. I mean, those are real numbers. These numbers that these people have, and I often ask myself. I asked Mark yesterday, What are they doing? Do they do this for their brand? Because I happen to think it's very bad for their brand. I think Scott Walker did a good thing. I think the way Walker, he saw it wasn't happening, wasn't going to happen and he just got out quickly. You know, he was favored. Don't forget. You know. That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win. What happened is he got out. I think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself. And frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems. So it's a great question. People should get out. Ivanka. Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines, it's true, I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka. She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is great. But Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon. They're going to be coming out very soon. Oh, Ivanka is going to Iowa. When are you going to Iowa? Very soon. I would say, I don't see threats. I mean, whatever it is I have to do. Mark is saying What are the top threats to your candidacy? Who knows? I mean, you're in the crazy world of politics. People change their minds. I'm going to make America great again. Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I'm going to do it. I'm going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that's awfully tough to compete with. And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there, I showed some of the developments that, I have many, many more because you can only, Simon and Schuster, you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it's even better but we didn't have that certified yet. So I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that's the kind of thinking our country needs right now. We are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words, I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don't believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership. There are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn't? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven't done anything. Right? They can't even get along when they agree. So here's the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can't do it. That's a part of the problem. No, they all agree. They all agree. They just didn't want to go through the unfair questions because they weren't questions; they were statements. You see, they were asking, they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way. And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC. The question is should the Fed raise rates? They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them. In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen. And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and she's not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn't want to see a big bubble burst during his administration. Janet Yellen should have raised the rates. She's not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn't want her to. And if she does it, you see what happens every time there's even a thought of raising them just a little bit. And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they're making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don't have leaders that know how to say to China, Don't do that. Don't do that. Because if you do that, we're going to put a big fat tax on you. Don't do that. And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn't do it. If you have the right messenger I'm really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections. I'm not watching any of them in particular. I'll be watching them on Tuesday night. But I'll be out there; we'll be out voting. But the election that I'm watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we've ever had in this country. We're so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership. That's a good question. Okay. So, Simon and Schuster came up to me. They wanted to do a book. They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that's what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country. And I said, I'll do it but we have to talk about the country. What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some greatphotos. I'm smiling. I'm happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn't like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It's a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you're talking about Crippled America and you're talking about all of the problems we have, I can't have a big smiley face up there. So that's how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me. I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn't go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me. Okay? Are the other Republicans afraid to debate? Well, some of them should be. Autism has become an epidemic. 25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics. Not even close. It has gotten totally out of control. I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Because you take a baby in, and I've seen it and I've seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump, I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse not for a child. And we've had so many instances, people that work for me just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. I only say, I'm in favor of vaccines. Do them over a longer period of time. Same amount but just in little sections. And I think you're going to have, I think you're going to see a big impact on autism. Speaking for myself, I'm okay with it. I think there's a certain, I know people that frankly there's no impact on their life whatsoever. There are many people. I would almost say leave it up to them. But I would be willing to check it off and say I will not get Social Security As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people. Don't forget, they pay in and they pay in and maybe do well and maybe some people want it. But the fact is that there are people that truly don't need it and there are many people that do need it very, very badly. And I would be willing to write mine off 100%. If I become President, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We'll have more jobs. We'll have more of everything. We were discussing disease. We were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words. It'll just pass on. I don't want to say politicians all talk, no action, but a lot of what we talked about is words and it'll be forgotten very quickly. If I'm President, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten. We'll find solutions and the world will respect us. They will respect us like never before. And it will actually be a friendlier world. And I have to say it's a great honor to be here tonight. I understand and I'm meeting with people that are terrific people. But I have to say something because it's about judgment. I am the only person on this dais, the only person, that fought very, very hard against us, and I wasn't a sitting politician, going into Iraq. Because I said going into Iraq, that was in 2003, you can check it out. I'll give you 25 different stories. In fact, a delegation was sent to my office this evening because I was so vocal about it. I'm a very militaristic person but you have to know when to use the military. I'm the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq. I would like and I think it's very important, I think it's important because it's about judgment. It's about judgment. I didn't want to go into Iraq and I fought it because what I said is you're going to destabilize the Middle East and that's what happened. Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding and he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he's ever done. Now or unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice but he did say that. And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word. But I would say, well, I think it was. And he actually said that. Did you say that? Okay, so I will say this though you was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. I think he was reading them off a sheet. And frankly I will have and I told him I will have the finest team that anybody's put together and we will solve a lot of problems. You know, right now, they know a lot and look at what's happening. The world is blowing up around us. We will have great teams and great people. You have to understand I am not sitting in the United States Senate with by the way the worst voting record there is today. Number one, I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I'm a businessman doing business transactions. I will know more about this and as you've said that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview it was a great interview. You said it; I didn't. I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what's going on in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess. Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well, that I don't like is if you make $200 million, you're paying 10%, you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making $50000 a year and has to hire H&amp;R Block to do it because it's so complicated. One thing I'll say to Ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years. So it's not a socialistic thing. What I'd like to do is, and I'll be putting it into plan in about two weeks and I think people are going to like it. It's a major reduction in taxes. It's a major reduction for the middle class. The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all but they'll pay more. I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax and I think it's unfair. I've made over $10 billion. I had a casino company. Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Chris will tell you, it's not Chris's fault either. But almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or I've filed for bankruptcy, Atlantic City is a disaster and I did great in Atlantic City. I knew when to get out. My timing was great and I got a lot of credit for it. Many of the great business people that you know, and Carl Icahn's going to work with me on making great deals to this country, but whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time, they have used the laws of the land Let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School Jeffrey Sonnenfeld wrote a paper recently. One of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still haven't recovered. In fact, today on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25000 or 30000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe. When Carly says the revenues went up that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal and it really to the destruction of the company. Now, one of the company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that, and Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this: She can't run any of my companies. That I can tell you. Well, first of all, the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars, not television scholars but legal scholars that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that. A woman gets pregnant. She's nine months. She walks across the border. She has the baby in the United States and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don't think so. And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that. We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people, and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They're coming from Asia to have babies here and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby. The 14th Amendment, it reads properly. You can go and it's probably going to have to check and go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court. But there are a lot of legal scholars that say that is not correct. And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no, we're the only country, one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years. I don't think so. I agree 100% by the way with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem for the obvious reasons. They do not. But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done. I've seen both sides but some of the greatest scholars agree with me without having to go through Congress. But if you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem. Well, I think it's wonderful and all but I did it a little half heartedly but I do mean it to a large extent. We have a country where to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was and the way it came out didn't sound great to me. We have to have assimilation to have a country. We have to have assimilation. I'm not the first one to say this. We have many people over the years for many, many years saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish. This is a reporter, not a high school kid, by the way. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important and it's a big part part of it. Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside and I think Chris knows that maybe as well as anybody. They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you live. We have a country based on laws. I will make sure those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run. Because when I ran and I brought this up at my opening marks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And then they found out with the killing of Kate from San Francisco and so many other crimes, they found that I was right. And most people, many people apologized to me. I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. So, we have a country of laws. They're going to go out and they'll come back if they deserve to come back. If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back. We're going to have a country again. Right now we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it and it can be done with proper management and it can be done with heart. I think it's a terrible statement. I think it's going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement I was watching and he said the statement and I said Wow, I can't believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women. One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. We're talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. I'd never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen. And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons. And somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places but certainly North Korea. We're talking about Iran. They're bad actors. Bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime you have somebody right now in North Korea who's got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them and we don't even mention them. Number one, I wouldn't have drawn the line but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility but I think he'd probably didn't do it not for that reason. Somehow he just doesn't have courage. There's something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force and had done something to Assad, if he had gone in there with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world. I think they had a responsibility. Absolutely. I think we have three of them here. I think they had a responsibility. So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria is a mess. You look at what's going on with ISIS in there. Now, look at this. We're fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe, and I maybe wrong in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don't get along with China. We don't get along with the heads of Mexico. We don't get along with anybody and yet at the same time they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and in every other way. We get along with nobody. I would get along I think with Putin and I would get along with others. And we will have a much more stable, stable, world. I believe that I will get along, we will do between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems. We won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11. He's got 1% in the polls. And how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway. As far as temperament and we all know that. As far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I've built a phenomenal business with incredible iconic assets, one of the really truly great real estate businesses. And I may be an entertainer because I've had tremendous success with number one best sellers all over the place with the Apprentice and everything else I've done. But I will tell you this what I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman and that's the kind of mindset that this country needs to bring it back. Because we owe $19 trillion right now. $19 trillion. And you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. I've actually been in politics all my life although I've been on that side as opposed to this side. I've now a politician for about three months. Obviously I'm doing pretty well. I'm number one in every poll by a lot. But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success. When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Gov. Pataki who by the way was a failed governor in New York. A very seriously failure. He wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say and I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago. I've gotten great credit for my timing. And that's what I'm about. I'm a businessman. Did really well. Really well. And Jeb, what I want to do is to put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that and I'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that. I'm Donald Trump. I wrote the Art of the Deal. I say not in a braggadocious way I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all of the world. And I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again, we build up our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life all together. Thank you. Boy, oh, boy. I didn't expect that. You know, Joe Arends and the group called and they said Would you come over and speak? I'm here for a certain reason. You know, it's called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans, hundreds of thousands of veterans, I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that. I didn't expect it. I didn't ask for it. I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They're our greatest people. They're being treated terribly. Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously, that's what's going on is incredible. But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it's not going to happen. And one of the things I thought I'd do and I'd stress so strongly, the veterans hospitals, obviously they have problems. They're not properly run. And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say I'm sorry. I'm going on vacation, believe me, it doesn't get much worse than that. So we're going to create a whole new system. We're going to take this system apart. And if they're not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we're going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals. And you're going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that's going to be broken down into something that's going to be very special. Right now, and you know it, we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen. So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected. To be here is an honor. They don't build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don't do them this way anymore. I actually said what about recommissioning, look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa. By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It's been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They're great. So this is a great ship and that's a great state. I just want to say that we're going to come out with some plans in a very short time. We're going to be building up our military. We're going to make our military so big and so strong and so great. And it will be so powerful that I don't think we're going to ever have to use it. Nobody's going to mess with us. That I can tell you. And we're going to have a President who's respected by Putin, who's respected by Iran. You know, let's talk about for two seconds, let's talk about the Iran deal. Now, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran. Obama talks about the Supreme Leader. Well, I'm not calling him a Supreme Leader. But he said the other day that after this rip off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again. We're finished with the United States. They're taking $150 billion. They're getting a deal that's going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think. They're going to self police, think about that one, they are going to go and self police. They've got the 24 day, they have 24 day provisions. And by the way, what people don't understand, the 24 day provision doesn't start, you know this, right? It doesn't start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there. It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I've ever seen of any kind. So, we are going to do things and this country right. We're not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there's still there and we don't even ask for them. One of them is there because he's a Christian. We have a writer. We have, the whole thing is absolutely insane. You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe, you know, I've been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I've been saying it. But it's possible, the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place. It's possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he's going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance. So we're going to see what happens. We have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration. Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President. And for two weeks, I said, you know, Rush Limbaugh, he's a great guy, he said He has suffered more incoming, meaning the press, than anybody I've seen. So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I'm the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it's a big problem. It is a big problem. So you remember for about two weeks, I said, Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President. And then you found out there's tremendous crime. There's tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country. So the drugs pour in and the money pours out. Not a good deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. The drug cartels are going wild. They cannot believe how stupid our government is. They are making a fortune. The drugs come in. The money goes out daily. And I saw it because I was on the border. I was there. And we saw it. And everybody sees it everyday. And we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership. None. None whatsoever. So, we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall, believe me. You know, a lot of politicians have said Oh, they're not going to pay. They don't know anything about, they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all. So here's the story. So here's the story. I said the other day to one of my people What is the United State's trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China? So let's start with China. Almost $400 billion a year. Now, if you have a company where you're losing $400 billion, you've got to do something very fast. We don't. We've been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. With Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right? They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars, millions of cars, and we sell them beef. We sell them beef. And they don't want it because their farmers don't want our beef. They protest and they send it back. All right? It's not going to happen that way anymore. Now, with Mexico, and I love Mexico. I have many, many people, many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments. Same with China. I have so many people. They pay me millions and millions. What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment? I don't think so. I had the largest bank in the world as a tenant. It's from China. Bigger than any bank in this country by many times. They're from China. The problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they're smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders. I love free trade. The concept is great. But you need smart people. I have the smartest people in this country lined up. I know the smartest. I have Carl Icahn. I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it. They're wealthy because they make good deals like me. I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent. You can't be a politician. Look, I'm fighting some very nice people. Very nice. Even though I'm leading in the polls. But they're very nice people. But they're never going to do anything with these countries. They're never going to be able to do it. It's an instinct. It's something that's special. They don't have it. Believe me, they don't have it. It's just going to be more of the same. So, we are going to make our country so great. We are going to make it strong. We are going to make it powerful. We're going to rebuild the military. We're going to make it so strong. We are going to take care of our veterans. And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day. The other week, two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31000 people showed up in a rainy rough day. 31000 people came to see us speak and we're talking about making America great again. Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20000 people, the basketball arena of the Mavericks. 20000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest. Everybody, think of it, 20000 people, there wasn't one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, There's got to be one. There was a word, two words that used to be used a lot called silent majority. They stopped using them. The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different. I don't think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they're not silent. People are not silent. They're disgusted with our incompetent politicians. They're disgusted with the people that are giving our country away. They're disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job. They're disgusted when they're allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they're standing there helpless and people just pour into the country. They're disgusted when a woman who's nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years. They're disgusted by what's happening to our country. And you're going to look around and you're going to remember who the people are that are here because we're doing something special. This is a movement. We're going to make our country great again. Believe me, we will make our country great again. I love you all. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. It's such an honor. I was called by Sen. Ted Cruz a few days ago and he said, Do you think we can get a really good crowd out here to protest this incompetent deal? And I said, Boy, can we get a crowd. And that was three days ago and look what shows up and I want to thank you. I want to thank you. So, I've been doing deals for a long time. I've been making lots of wonderful deals, great deals. That's what I do. Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean, never. Now, Ted and everybody else have gone through all of the details and we can talk about the 24 days, which is ridiculous. We can talk about the $150 billion, which by the way they get even if the deal isn't approved. They get it just for going to the table. We can talk about the fact that we have four wonderful people over there and frankly they're never going to come back with this group. And I'll say this: If I win the presidency, I guarantee you that those four prisoners are back in our country before I even take office. I guarantee that. They will be back before I ever take office because they know that's what has to happen. Okay? They know it. And if they don't know it, I'm telling them right now. So, I have a story that just came out an hour ago and as President Obama calls him very routinely, he calls him the Supreme Leader. Our President is calling the person who is really the boss in Iran Supreme Leader and I look at people shaking their head; they can't believe it. But it just came out a little while ago, he said Israel will not exist in 25 years. Think of that. He just said this. He also said very strongly, very, very strongly that This is the end of our dealings with the United States. We want nothing more to do with them. We're not going to do anything right here. We made this deal. It's a phenomenal deal. We're not going to deal with the United States anymore. And that's what he just said and this was a very short period of time ago. So, they rip us off. They take our money. They make us look like fools. And now they're back to being who they really are. They don't want Israel to survive. They will not let Israel survive with incompetent leadership like we have right now. Israel will not survive. And then when it's all done or they think it's all done, they come out with these unbelievable nasty statements that Israel won't be around in 25 years and that we will have no dealings and we will have no further dealings with the United States. Now, the people that we were negotiating with and were working on the sanctions, with including and as an example Russia who is selling tremendous missiles to Iran. You know that. Ballistic missiles being sold. All of these countries, all of these countries, are going to do business with Iran. They're going to make lots of money and lots of other things with Iran. And we're going to do, and we're going to get nothing. Nothing. We are led by very, very stupid people. Very, very stupid people. We cannot let it continue. We are a country that owes $19 trillion. We lose everywhere. We lose militarily. We can't beat ISIS. Give me a break! We can't beat anybody. Our vets are being treated horribly. It will change. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. Believe me. I agree. You'll never get bored of winning. We'd never get bored. We are going to turn this country around. We are going to start winning big league on trade, militarily. We're going to build up our military. We're going to have such a strong military that nobody, nobody, is going to mess with us. We're not going to have to use it. I really, really this tremendous crowd. We are going to make America great again! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. The Chairman just left as you probably know and he's been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. And as you know, that's what I've wanted. I wanted fairness. I don't have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. We're leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we're over 30%. We've actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. And frankly, I've felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it's Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what's happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge. So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that's what it's all about. We have to make our country great again. This is a self funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don't need money and I don't want money. And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other. I'm not controlled by lobbyists. I'm not controlled by anybody. I'm controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again. Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing. The question was what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing. Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I've seen that over the last two months. They really have been very fair. No, I have no intention of changing my mind. Well, I think the big thing that's changed is, and it's been obvious to all, number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship. Nobody thought I was going to run and they said Oh, he won't run and he won't put in his papers. And he wouldn't do all of this. I did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It's a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received. And I think the thing that's changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I'd be running for President. So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect. So that was very important. No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge. Well, you don't have to be met when you're at 2%. It's one of those things. That's the way life works. And I like Gov. Chris Christie, by the way. Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up. You saw him. He was here a little while ago. And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly. Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English and I think that while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English. And that's how assimilation takes. And that's how, I mean, whether people like it or not that's how we assimilate and that's how we go on to that next phase and that next stage. And that's how people that don't speak, and I'm not just talking about Spanish; I'm talking about from various parts of the world, that's how they will become successful and do great. So I think it's more appropriate to be speaking English. Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it's a country based on borders and our country is based on laws. And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that. And this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world. When people come illegally, we cannot allow that. And I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That's been proven. And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I've been proven right. And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven't done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will. The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We're a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws. And we will make sure that that takes place. With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States. When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you're not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay. We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen. I don't know enough about it to comment on it. Was she jailed? I really don't know much about it. That's absolutely false. I win at golf. I win at golf. That I can tell you. Well, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody. I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants. Don't forget if I didn't bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn't be asking the question. Nobody would be even talking about immigration. And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor. Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up. But if I didn't bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we're talking about and it happens to be a very important subject. I have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just, we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner. But if I didn't bring it up, nobody would be talking about it. Well, there is gridlock in Congress right now and that's because there's no leadership at the top. You have to be able to lead. You have to be able to get people into your office. You have to get people go to them. Any way you want to do it. But you have to be able to lead. There is no leadership at the top. Signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run. I don't want to talk about that. It's inappropriate. Tom Brady? Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine. He's a great guy. For those of you who don't know him, he's a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete. He is really a very good friend of mine. And I just spoke to him a little while ago. He's so thrilled and so happy. Tom Brady, I think what they've done is terrible. And he's been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it. But I'm very happy for Tom. As far as the Commissioner is concerned, they're having a rough year. Let's face it. They're having a very rough year. Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming. And it's a huge humanitarian problem. And I just say this. This United States has tremendous problems of their own. We have infrastructure that we have to fix. We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart. Our nation's in such trouble. That's why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help. But we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have, health care, which is a mess. You know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%. People are saying This is turning out to be a disaster. Deductibles are through the roof. The deductibles on Obamacare it's through the roof. So we have a lot of problems. We have to take care of our vets. We have to build up our military. Just the other day, Gen. Ray Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness. Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton, and I've said she's the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that's about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place. I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It's going to lead to nuclear proliferation, the 24 day clause, everything about it. We don't even get our prisoners back. You say who negotiates a thing like that? That won't happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump. You'll see it later. Yeah. They don't want to hear it. I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else. You see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person. Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn't supposed to run. I'm this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I'm not supposed to be running for office. The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade. And I'm not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us. China, taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1 trillion and we're paying them interest. We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount, $1 trillion. Now, that's like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That's not going to happen with me. Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I'll be honest. I think he's a very nice person. I think he's a very low energy person and I don't think that's what the country needs. I hear he's going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me. And honestly, look, he's getting the money from special interests. He's getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they're making him do it because he's crashing in the polls. So I don't know what's going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads, I don't know. I know that my life will continue. I just don't know. I mean nobody's ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I've done. You know, one of the things I'm most honored about is that so far everybody that's attacked me has gone down the tubes. You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he's at zero. You have Perry attacked me. Now he's getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he's getting out of the race. He was at zero. Everybody, Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll, the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I'm leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me. Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big. So I don't know. Are they going to spend, he's going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this, they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money. Nobody knows the system better than me. They have total control. You understand it very well because you've been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate. I will tell you this: Nobody's putting up millions of dollars for me. I'm putting up my own money. In fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you're in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like, am I a fool? I feel very foolish. And when I was in Iowa last week, I said What do you think? Can I take, One man offered me, a big lobbyist, offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa, great crowd, 4000 people, I said Can I take it? And would you believe I'm not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won't do anything. And they all stood up and said No, no, don't take it. The fact is I'm the only self funder. I'm putting up my own money. I know there have been some super PACs, 5 or 6 super PACs, where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you're not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don't know what they're going to do. Hopefully, if they're going to do something it's going to be nice. But I don't know anything about them. But just in a nutshell, I'm funding my own campaign. Nobody else's. When people advertise, and I hope the voters can see this. Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests. So just remember that. Our country could be doing much better. We have deficits that are enormous. We have all bad trade agreements. We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared. We have a military that needs help and especially in these times. We have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don't even work. Okay? If anybody saw that report. The phones don't work. They're 40 years old. They have wires that are no good. Nothing works. Our country doesn't work. Everybody wins except us. We need victories in this country. We don't have victories any more. Our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems. I think it's great that Carly Fiorina in the debate. I was in favor of her being, I think she should be in the debate. I don't like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it. They're not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody. But I think they should because there's too many people. Because when you have 11, you're not getting to hear me and you're not getting to hear other people talking and I think that's too bad. I think 11 is a lot of people. But I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate. I think maybe Joe Biden inclined not to get in the race. I think it's going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton. A lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate. I don't know that to be true. But I think it depends on what happens with her. I think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not. Who knows? Oh, he's not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we're very happy about that. We don't want anything, and I told him. I said, I don't know if it's appropriate Reince for you to be here because I don't want anything, You know, you guys will end up saying he's endorsing Trump. So I suggested frankly that I'm fine with him not being here because I don't want anybody to think he's endorsing. As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it's a little bit sad. Don't forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn't have the energy. But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists. And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not, if I were him, I'd spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they're at a point where they're not going to leave because they're fed up with what's happening in this country, but I think they're going to go to people other than Jeb. I don't know. Right now, I'm interested in jobs. One thing, one of the groups, it was actually CNN. I shouldn't say that. But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing. And I don't mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country. You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million. When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people. We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all. Our country can be great again. We have to put people back to work. Would I bring my children into the administration? I will tell you they are very capable. The answer is probably not. But having them in would be very good. They're very, very capable children. The second part I won't bother asking you. It's no longer pertinent. Kanye West? You know what? I'll never say bad about him. You know why? Because he loves Trump. He loves Trump. He goes around saying Trump is my all time hero. He says it to everybody. So, Kanye West, I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I'll have to run against him. I don't know. So I'll take that back. But he's been so nice to me. You people have sort of seen because I've been a counter puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me. No, my supporters are really supporting me because I'm very competent, because they know that I'm not going to let China rip us off. I'm not going to let Japan rip us off. Japan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu, their big tractor maker, and others. We're not going to let this happen anymore. They do, you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you've ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I've never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don't even want it. It's going to end and they're going to like us. In this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It's a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world. I get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico. I love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics, many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships. And in the package that we gave you, you'll see there's a poll and I'm number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics. So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We're going to be great to the vets. We're going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable. All of these things, we're going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that's much better and much less expensive. We're going to get rid of it. We're going to repeal it. It's going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened. But we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we're going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I'll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. And here is your pledge. You know it's a bubble waiting to explode, and I've been saying that for a long time. I've been saying what they're doing in China is a bubble waiting to explode. And just remember something, when it's a bubblewe can't be brought down by that bubble. They've done things that caused it. We can't be brought down by that bubble. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to tell you a story about Nashville. You're not even going to believe it. But it's a very personal story. It's a very special place to me for a very special reason. But maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us. She's 92 years old. We don't talk about age but she's 92. And she looks magnificent. And her name is Beada and she's become very famous. You know who Beada is, right? Beada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful. So, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life. She hasn't seen anybody that really did it to her. And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she's going to vote for Trump. I think, right? Thank you, darling. I really appreciate it. You know, she's become so famous. She's on television all over the world now. I have to be nervous even talking to her, you're so famous. It's great. Beada, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it. Because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we're going to take this country back and we're going to make this country so great again and so strong again. Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville. So, years ago, many years ago, like I hate to say 40 but I won't say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain. And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good. But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that's what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly. I shouldn't say that because you're not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right? But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee. And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything. And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it's one of the great buildings of the world and it's one of the great successes. And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience. And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places, you know, when you're leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you're not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don't want you at all. And we'll talk about the polls in a second. But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let's do this. And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my, it's not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it's so important and it's been such a great, from the day I built it it was a home run. And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee. So, I really, it's an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you. Real honor. So, coming over I heard and I watched television, you know, they have all these cameras back there and they're live. And I guess we're live on CNN, we're live on so many different things. It's always difficult. You know, when you're always live, you've got to change up your speech. You can't make the speech over and over The other candidates don't get covered live ever, except for the debate. So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they'll be even substantially higher than that. So I would've said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN, that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity. When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now, maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research, so many of this, there's so many good, Alzheimer's, you know, there's so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I'm not showing up. You know, it's interesting. So they'll get 2 million, a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they've been doing them for a long time. They don't do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression, it draws flies? That's what it draws. So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television. Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should. So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it's not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don't know. Here's the thing. If I don't do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don't care about CNN. Honestly. No, they're going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera. They're actually very nice. But they're going to make a lot of money and, you know, it's something we should consider. So we'll all consider it together. But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they're DREAMERs. And I said, What about our children? Why can't our children that are in the country, why can't they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that. You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets. You know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many casesare treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have, our wounded warriors are, these are the greatest people we have. And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it's wonderful, you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what's happening. This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that's possible too. They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there's supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there's nobody there. And the veterans, I don't know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying Where are the people? And then, they said, What happened? And they said, This happens all the time. There was not even, nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history, in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor. When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I'm like Get me, I'd go crazy. It's true. Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house? Right? Beada remembers that. You'd have a cold. The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top. And he'd come over to your house, check you out, fine. Those days don't exist anymore. You know, we're in age of Obamacare where nothing exists. By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor's office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days. One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation. Now, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days. So the wait's now the longest in history and that's the way we're treating our greatest people and that's not right and we're going to change that. We're going to change that. We have right now, and people don't know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness. You know, I'm a Republican. I'm a conservative. But I'm just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens, they become weak. You know, they go to Washington, We're going to stop Obamacare. We're going to stop this. We're going to do this. We're going to do that. Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go Oh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'm in Washington. It's amazing. Isn't it amazing? Don't you agree? I won't happen to me, I promise. And if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won't. I promise. I promise. But you know, they show those phony statistics where we're 5% unemployment. 5%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not. But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking. So if you're looking for a job and you can't find it and you stop for a while, you know, after a while you sort of like It's not happening. It's not going to happen. I don't know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay? So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It's hard to believe. We have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money. Japan's taking our money. Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they're killing us on trade. You know that. In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have You know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don't want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It's about doing the right thing. One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we're leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening. We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech, that's like luck. That's from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31000 people and it was the most unbelievable. And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire. Leading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we're leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who's sitting, you have a governor who's been there for eight years and Trump, ? I love Florida and I'm there a lot. What could be in Florida? Great weather. You have great weather but Florida has great weather. Big advantage. But you know, I'm leading big in Florida. But one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I'm leading really big. And in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability, you know, I'm the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say, I think I had one poll where I'm 41%, almost 41%, can you imagine? 41%. There's 17 people. So I'm at 41% with 17 people and they said Trump's at 41% but look, you can't even hear it. You know, Trump says bleh. Nobody knows what they just said. But there are some people that don't like him. It's unbelievable. I'm the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity. No, it's incredible. The press, ayeyayay. Well, yesterday, you might have seen me. I was in South Carolina. I made a speech. I had to bring it up. The New York Times to me is a big deal. You know, I'm from New York. Very liberal paper but that's okay. You know, not everybody could be like us. But it's still the New York Times. Right? We have to admit, still the New York Times. And I'm on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal. But yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator. Low level guy. This one didn't like me. By the way, I think I'm going to win the Hispanic vote and I think, you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me. I love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many, I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They're great people. And I said, I'm going to win. And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don't want people coming in illegally. You know it's true. It's true. So there's this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we're way up and Lindsey at 4% and he's the Senator. I'm at 30%. So I wrote him a note, Congratulations. I'm only beating you in your home state by 26 points. So anyways, who cares. But they did something that nobody reported. They say, Oh but do people like Trump? By the way, this election is not going to be like. I think I'm a nice person. I love people. I want to help people. Women's health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn't important because he didn't want to fund them. And then he said, Oh, I misspoke. But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person. But I think it's actually going to be an election based on competence. We're tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it's time. But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. In another act of political magic, Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative, nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. From negative to positive. This is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don't need, but I want to be sure because if I used the word the incorrectly, they'll say, He didn't, Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month. A feat that Monmouth University's Patrick Murray's highly respected pollster called astounding. Called it astounding. Nobody else wrote about it. That defies any rule in presidential politics that I've ever seen, said this highly respected man. Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he's never seen that before. And you know what? That's because people have heard me and they say You're such a nice person. No, they want, they say he's a man, I've made a tremendous amount of money. I've had tremendous success. And I don't say that braggingly. That's the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is. But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody. And we are more than double everybody. You saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll. I was the same thing. Much, much higher, double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates. And the reason is people in this country are smart. They don't believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people, you know, why are they doing this? I mean, why are they even saying it? You'd think that if somebody's good for the country, and I'll be great for the country because I'm going to make great deals for our country. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. You'd think somebody, even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal. Somebody who's going to make the country, why are they knocking it? Why are they knocking? Why do they fight? You'd think they'd say Let's do it. It's good. It's good for all of us. Because our country is in trouble. We owe now $19 trillion. You know, I've been saying $18 trillion for a while now. But now it starts to go up quickly. And by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in 2016, you want to see bad deficits? You want to see it go up? You're going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it's no good. Have you noticed, and you've seen it yourself, the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility, unless you're close to death, you're never going to use it. You can't use it because the deductibility is so high. But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It's a disaster. And on top of that, it's going to cost the country a fortune. So it's not only costing you a lot of money, it's going to cost the country a fortune. So we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it. But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won't mention names, some of them when they hear my name, I was talking, we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us. Okay? Who came down. And she actually said Some of them when they hear your name it looks like they're a boiler waiting to explode. It's true. Now, number one, they look bad because they said, do you remember the beginning? Like three, four months ago. They said, He's a clown. He's a clown. Just having fun. You know, I went to a great school. I did great. I did, everything was great. I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune. I then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody. I jokingly say but I mean it, the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it's true. Nothing tops the Bible. But the Art of the Deal, great success. Many books, bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers. Then I do The Apprentice. I've never done television. I do The Apprentice. It's one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way. And NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me. They came up to my office, the head of Comcast, great guy, I won't use names. Just say Steve. No, honestly he's a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, Donald, we're renewing The Apprentice. Please, you'll have to do, you have to do it. I said, Honestly, Steve, I'm running for President. I want to make our country great again. I want to make, And they didn't believe me. And I said it four times. They didn't believe me. Nobody believed that I was going to run. Nobody. My wife didn't even believe me, but now she does. But she actually said If you actually say you're going to run, you're going to do great because people like you. She actually said They'd love you but I don't want to brag. But she said, If you actually run, not you may run, you may not run, who knows? But she said If you actually say, So the NBC guys come up, terrific people. I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows. In fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice. So Mark Burnett, who's a great guy, he calls up and he goes I don't believe it. You're not taking a renewal. The word is renewal. I said, That's right, Mark. I'm going to run for President. No, no, no, you have to, nobody doesn't take a renewal. It's unheard of in primetime television. Two hours primetime. Are you crazy? I said, Mark, I have to do this. I've done so well in this country. I have to do it. We can save our country. We can save our country. So anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it. I told them I'm not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced. They don't like me anymore. It's amazing. They do not like me. But it's too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you. You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice, there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, Why do you think that is? I said Because I'm special. And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically, I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing. But so I had a great experience. So here I am, great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said It will never be successful because you know to have a big hit, a really a number one hit, you have to, and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women. And I'll never forget, I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, Truman loses and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump? And I said, Am I so bad? Am I so bad? Tell me, am I so bad? And it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked. So you know I saved those things. But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it's going to be hard. It's going to be a lot of work. It's going to be a lot of time. I wouldn't leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You're elected President. You're in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I'd maybe never leave! How cool is that? He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I'll try, I don't know maybe there's some rules against it. So maybe I can't. But I'll do the fundraisers in the White House. He and his wife left, I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows. And I say why? Why aren't they flying at least the same plane? Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes. More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, Let's do it from the White House. This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don't spend any money of the taxpayers. And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. We're doing our show live from the White House or something. So we don't pay any money. We don't have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you, do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things? With hundreds and hundreds of security and you're closing down Burbank, California. I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say What's going on? You can't move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city. And he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I'm buying which is only a couple of blocks. It's true. I'm building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it's going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say What's going on? How did Trump get it? One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they're the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we're building this phenomenal hotel, Trump International Hotel, right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It's going to open just in time, and by the way, listen to this one. We're under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget. So we're actually going to be opening and it'll be great. But he can use my hotel. I'll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don't have to do that. But you'd say to yourself why, you know, it's a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don't want to waste time. You've got to do this. You've got to make deals. I've got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us. Carl Icahn, incredible guy. Right? Incredible guy. Great deal maker. I've got some of the greatest deal makers in the world. They're all calling me too. They said You didn't ask me. I have these guys calling me up, the best in the world. Now, I know the best. I also know guys that are overrated. I know guys that you haven't heard of that honestly are phenomenal. I know a lot that you have heard of that aren't really that good, that are overrated in my opinion. But they're the best in the world. And they're calling me. They don't want money. They're worth billions of dollars. But when I put, let's say, Carl Icahn and I'll say Carl, do me a favor. Handle China. We're going to make a great deal. No, no, we're going to make a great deal because that's what happens. You know, that's what happens. So, we're going to take back our trade. If you look at China, if you look at Japan, I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships, the biggest ships I've ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything's nice. Except that it doesn't help us. When does it help us? When does it help us? We sell them beef. Beef. And then they don't want it. Because you know, do you ever see what's going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it's very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over We don't want it. They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships. And I say, What are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing. And I'm a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade. When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It's like peanuts. Balance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has, it's probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They've taken our money. They've taken our jobs. They've taken everything. They've taken so much. And they're creating a bubble and you know interestingly we're so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might. And we've got to be smart. I made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China. The Bank of America building in San Francisco, I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows. You know, all these guys come to Forbes. Oh, Trump's worth only $5 billion or $4 billion. Or whatever. He's only worth $5 billion. It's like a bankrupt magazine. They don't even know my numbers. They said, Well, we haven't been able to look at about 400 of his companies. So I filed. Interestingly, they said He'll never run. He'll never run. Then I announced. Then they said, Oh, he'll never file his form whatever. That's a single page where basically you're signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement. I signed my form. And they said, Well, he'll never ever put in his financials. And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, He'll ask for extensions but he'll never show because he's probably not as rich as people think. But actually I'm much richer and I put in my financials, it's true. It's true. And Forbes and another group said, No, no, we don't know what these companies are. I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn't going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It's such a great company I've built. So they said, He'll never put in his financials. I put in the financials. And everybody, they're much bigger. It's a much bigger, you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I'm very proud of it. But they say, He'll never file. He'll never file. Then they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn't really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million? The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more. So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that. So it says $50 million or more. So I checked many of them. I don't know how many. I think there's 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don't know, I think it's 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they'll kill me if I'm wrong. But I'm not sure. But I think it's like 23 boxes. $50 million or more. So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion. So it says $50 million or more, I go 50. So they'll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more. And they add them up and they say Well, he's worth $3 billion. It's really, this is the press. And they have no clue. Those statements aren't really meant for me, it's not meant for a guy like me. But with all of that the statements were so good. They're so good. They're so good. And you know, one of the things I'm doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing? Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets. But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn't know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign. So all over the place, I'm spending millions of dollars. I'm turning down millions. I don't want your money. I don't want your money. Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn't have to make. But they put it up. It's all over CNN. Trump is asking for $100. I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy, Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He'll sell you a car any day of the week, right? And you know the guy is, like 2000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they're serving. So they put up a sign. I don't want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That's hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story, Trump accepting contributions. I can't believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it's like peanuts. It doesn't mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do. The bottom line is I am self funding my campaign. I'm self funding. I don't want to have anybody giving. I don't need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it's not a lot of money but it's great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money. But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1000. But it doesn't amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign. How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? Dear So and So, I'm sorry I don't really want your money. How do you write a letter like that? I want them to invest in it. You know, but they're not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million. I had a big lobbyist asked me to have, he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down. And then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there's a sign, $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they're doing this big thing about all day long last night about, I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that's the press. That's the media. Yeah, the criminal media. I mean, there's truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it's wrong. But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2000 people. It had to be a record. The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don't forget. When I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I'm leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow. You have not been treated fairly. No, you haven't been treated fairly. You have not been treated fairly. You know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back. You people don't. The Tea Party people are incredible people. These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media. It's disgusting. And you will be surprised how big you are. You don't know how big you are. You don't know the power that you have. I mean it. You don't know the power that you have. The Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want. I don't care about names. But the Tea Party has tremendous power. I talked silent majority. But the silent majority is more than Tea Party. It's Democrats. It's poor people. It's rich people. It's everybody. It's evangelicals. One of the things that made me so happy, I'm a protestant. I'm a presbyterian. Right?, is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful, like these polls are great. You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters. They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. What do you have to do that for? Every week they come out with a new poll. Right? Hey, I'm rich. I could hire a hundred poll. I don't want to waste money. You know, why should I pay? I know in one caselike $150000 a month. And you know, then they're arrogant guys. They think they're hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say. You've got to say this. You've got to be politically correct. No way. I don't have time to be political. No, it's true. It's true. I don't have time to be political. You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct. You saw the anchor baby thing. Did you see that with where I'm on? And somebody fromit's the same network, CNN again, he said, You know the name anchor baby is very insulting? I said, What would you call it? And he gave me like nine words. A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that. I said, How can I say that? It's too long. It's anchor baby. And then Bush, Jeb. Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person. Honestly. If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won't talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person. So Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo. You know, don't say this, don't say that. All these things. Pages of stuff. But one of the things, Never use the term 'anchor baby'. So all of a sudden, he's using the term anchor baby just last week. And with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me. They expect me. They gave up. Okay? With him, they killed him. They just killed him. It didn't stop. And then he blamed it on the Asians. He said, you know, did you see that? And then the New York Times did an editorial How dare you attack the Asians? So he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics. He said, Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies. And now the Asians all hate him. It's true. But the Asians love me and I love them. I love them. So he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says, a couple of years ago, Don't use this term, and now he's using it because he has to. Because baby, you know, think of it. Think of it. I want to build a wall. Okay? So easy. So easy. When this clown, Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name, no, he's a baseball player. Ramos. Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player. He's a nice baseball player. But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters. Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming. So I even had liberal people from CBS, I actually said to the CBS guy Yes? and this guy stands up and starts screaming. So when he, and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him. I didn't do anything like, I didn't do anything. Except for the Times. And that's what I alluded to before. The Times said, Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him. I didn't scream at him. But he was screaming at me. And much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don't wear a toupee, and I proved it, I won't bring anybody up. I won't bring anybody up. But I don't. But think of it. I'm in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer, this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of, saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don't. So, I'm on the front page of the New York Times. I can't even talk about it. I'm embarrassed to talk about it. But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million. They didn't mention that. They also didn't mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Did you know that? His daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Oh, you didn't know that. Oh. No, they didn't mention that. No, no. They said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn't. No, he's screaming at me. So we very nicely, and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk. He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit. You know, he's a very emotional man. But, he said, You can't build a wall because you can't do it. So, 2000 years ago in China, we always get back to China, 2000 years ago, the Great Wall of China, oh, we'd like to have a wall. This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don't go through so easy. They built a wall 2000 years ago that's 13000 miles. Think of that. That's a big wall. That's serious wall, right? This was 2000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit, you know, took a long time. But 13000 miles that's a long time. They had no tractors. They didn't have Caterpillars. Of course, today, we use Komatsus because they're made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar's stock is down. It's terrible. We'll change that around. Believe me. Believe me. But, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15, I would say, look we have 2000 miles as opposed to 13000. But you don't need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places. And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn't. Because I'm a great builder. What I do best is build. I'm not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I'm the opposite. I get it built. So, one of the reasons it couldn't get built is because they couldn't get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn't get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall. And they're killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people. Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family. Last week in California, a 66 year old veteran, a female, a veteran, 66, got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66 years old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily. But this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That's why the hat is so successful. The white one, right? But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn't sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing. But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it's rough stuff, it's rough stuff. And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press. Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said Trump has received more incoming than any human being I've ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he's going to apologize and he doubles down. I got credit. I got credit. No, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don't mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right. So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming. In fact that was my first two weeks. I said Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half? I don't know if I can make it. It was brutal. Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they've apologized to me. Everybody says I'm right. And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration. They wouldn't even be talking about it. They wouldn't even be talking about it. And we're going to build a wall and we're going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They're going to be out so fast. One of the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of those gang members. We're going to be, you know, you look at what's going on with Baltimore, you look at what's going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin. You know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys, we need law and order. We need law and order. I mean, they allowed, in one night, that first night in Baltimore, they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren't allowed to protect people. We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be, the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He's a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they're allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me. We have some incredible people. But we have to be tough. We have to be smart. You know, I know you're going to have some bad apples. You're going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it's disgusting and it's horrible. But that's such a tiny percentage. The problem is the good work doesn't get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99%. I mean, the good work with the police. It's 99%. That one little thing. And it's horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don't have to go into them. But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was. But we need law and order. We need our police. They're great people. They do a phenomenal job. They're right now afraid of doing anything. They're afraid. I mean, I know cities. I won't mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don't want to be thrown off the police force. And then you wonder why there's crimes in our cities. So we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it. We also have to focus on what we have, look, Ukraine. I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good. But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries. We're now sending F-22s. That's the newest fighters. The best in the world. We're sending fighters every, Where's Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree. But why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn't hate us. I think he'd like me. I'd get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn't like him in all fairness. They don't have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I'd get along with these people. Think of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they're going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that. So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay? But think of it. So, Ukraine, let's take a few of these things and then I'm getting the hell out of here; I'm going back to New York. Do you mind? Maybe I'll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight. Can I do that? I'd actually rather, I love, by the way, this is not a politician speaking. Believe me. I hope. I love country music. I love it. Hey, Trace Adkins, right? And who else won on The Apprentice? Who else? John Rich. My kids love those two guys. John Rich. And who else? Who did really well? Clint Black. Right? Clint Black. He did great. And my Trace, how good is Trace, okay? You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, Who the hell is he? Who is he? I didn't know who Trace was. I'd never heard of him. And he wasn't a big name. And he came on, just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it nowit went to number one. And then he came to me the next yearbut Trace came to me and he goes, you know, at certain awards show, I won't mention the name, but he said Last year, I couldn't get into the show and this year I'm hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you. Nice, right? I know, nice. But those three guys, they're great and they're just fantastic people. But we've got to make our country so strong. We have to make our country rich again. A person came up and said, Oh, that's not nice. What's not nice? They said rich, you know, to say we're going to make our country rich. We can't make our country great if we're going to be poor. We're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. China, think of this, China we owe $1 trillion to. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1 trillion. How do you do that? That's like a magic act. Right? It's true. Japan sells us cars by the millions. They make a fortune. They come in, they sell us cars by the millions. And we owe them the exact same amount. We owe them $1 trillion. How come if they're selling us cars we owe them money? Think of it. Put on your business. See? I have a natural instinct for this stuff. Right? You know? Right? If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money? But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds. And we're paying interests on them and we owe them money. So, it'll change. It can change. It's not even going to be hard. People don't realize. See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal. People don't realize. Oh, and somebody said Sharon. It was Sharon. Where's Sharon? She gave me such a hard time. Where's Sharon? Where the hell is she? You could have both Sharons stand up actually. Where are they? Both of them. Sharon is great. Oh, did they go after her. She took a lot of incoming. Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming? I think so. Right? Thank you, darling. So, we are going to do something that if I get elected, and again they said I'll never run and now. One guy said, John McLaughlin, you ever watch the McLaughlin Report? I like him. And one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he'll never make it as a President. He'll never get elected. He'll never make it. And John McLaughlin, this crusty guy who I like; I don't know him. I never met him, I don't think. But I like. He's sitting there and he goes, and he got angry, he goes Why wouldn't he make it? You tell me why. He's been a tremendous success in everything he's done. I go all over the world. I see him name. I see his name all over. He's a great success. And he said, I think this is the word, He's a man of great achievement. Why wouldn't he make it? And I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up. You know, because you need somebody of great achievement. You need, I've produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year. I don't have to worry about Obamacare. I take such good care of my employees. I have thousands of employees. I take good care of them. We have great plans. My employees are lucky. They hit the lotto, okay? But I take great care, education and health care, and my people are very happy. But I've done this for a long time, and I've seen ups and downs. I've seen market crashes. I've seen friends of mine go bankrupt. You've never seen, I've never gone bankrupt. By the way, I've used the laws to my advantage and companies. I buy a company. I throw it into a chapter. I negotiate with banks. I kill. You know. And then they say Trump goes bankrupt. These people, they don't have any, Now, when other people do that, when a Carl does it, I mean, they do it all the time. They use it all the time. It's called using your head. It's called using the laws. Actually I did a good job didn't I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said, I do what every other great businessman does. I buy a company, you know, it's one company was sort of interesting. A friend of mine had it. Good guy. And the banks were just killing him. They were mean. And banks can be mean, right? You've got to teach them how to behave, right? So this guy was just getting beaten. And I did him a favor and I called up the banks. And I said Do me this, do this, do this, do that. They said, We won't do that. No, we won't do that. I said, You're making a mistake. Anyways, it's sort of a little bit complicated. I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, Don't do this. I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story Trump files bankruptcy. Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank, ayeyeye. They see me walking down the street and they go Hey, hey, hey. But then I'm good at that stuff, you know? I'm really good at that stuff. But you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage. Atlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar's went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar's? Caesar's filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things. I said, Don't go into Iraq even though I'm a very militaristic person. I said Don't go into Iraq and they shouldn't have because I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get, $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place. We can't even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we're giving them, they're going to take off and they're going to get the oil, they're going to get everything. The oil they don't get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing. So I had vision in 2004, Reuters, actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don't do Iraq. Now, I'm much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use. So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That's called vision. I should get credit for vision. And again, this isn't bragging. Normally, I wouldn't say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? I mean, normally I wouldn't. So I got great credit. I got out. But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they're bankrupt. They went bankrupt. But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it. Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win. We are going to have victories again. We are going to win. In fact, last night in front of the audience and I've never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we're going to have so many victories. And then I said we're going to win here. We're going to win on trade. We're going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody's going to play with us. Nobody's going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody. And we're going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out. In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore. And everyone stood up and said No, no, no, we want to keep winning. If I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything. I will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid. We are going to have something that's so special. And you know, my whole fame is and I'll say it once. We will make America truly great again. And thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much! Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Thank you. Oh, that's so beautiful. You know, now I know how the great Billy Graham felt because this is the same feeling. We love Billy Graham. We love Billy Graham. You know, this all started, we had a hotel and we were going to have 250 or 300 people. And the hotel was great. They called and said, Something's happening here. We can't hold this. This is crazy, what's going on. And then we went to the convention center and they could have 10000 people and we're all set and we're excited. And the next day they said, Too many people. We can't put them in. So we came here. We came here. You know, today if you noticed, we have a stock market not doing so well. We have a country not doing so well. We've been saying it for a long time. We have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us tonight, well, exclude them. But we have politicians that don't have a clue. They're all talk; they're no action. What's happening to this country is disgraceful. And you know, when I announced I was running for President, I brought up the subject of illegal immigration. And I took a lot of heat, that, I can tell you. Rush Limbaugh actually said incoming, He got more incoming than anybody I've ever seen. And two weeks later, everybody was apologizing to me. They saw that I was right. Between what happened in San Francisco to incredible Kate and her family is such an incredible family, Jamiel Shaw, and so many people have been so badly hurt. The other day in California last week, a woman 66 years old, a veteran, was killed, raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed by an illegal immigrant. We have to do it. We have to do something. We have to do something. You know, if it rains, I'll take off my hat and I'll prove once and for all that it's mine, okay? The people that built this country. That's what we have here. I mean, the people that built the country. Great people. So we'll start with a little talk on the illegal immigration, what's going on. We're going to stop it. We're going to build a wall and it's going to be. You know, it's amazing. The politicians 10 years ago, 15 years ago, they all wanted a wall. But it never went. It never happened. Because somebody didn't want it. Probably a lobbyist. You know, all these guys like Bush and like Hillary Clinton, they're all taken care of, I don't know if you know, it's true. No, but when Hillary has $60 million and when Jeb Bush who's totally in favor of Common Core, weak on immigration, right? Very weak on immigration. Wants to let people come in. Although now, he is using anchor baby. You know, he put out a memo, You cannot use anchor baby. Now, because I used it, he's using it. Politicians. But when they have, in his case, $114 million, in Hillary's case, she's got $60 million. Now, I don't know that she's going to make it to the game. What do you think? I'm not sure that she's making it to the game. Some bad things came out today. You know, those classified, you know the word classified. You know, they've destroyed Gen. Petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening here. So it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately. But, we have right now and I just got these numbers today. I said What are they? 7% of all of the births in this country are illegal immigrants. Okay? Can't afford it. And they're supposed to stay. Now, I turned out to be right. The 14th Amendment. You know, I had these guys, You can't change the 14th Amendment. It will take so long. On that I agree. But you know what? An act of Congress, the 14th Amendment, I was right on it. You can do something with it and you can do something fast. You can do something fast. So we have 300000 babies a year. 300000 that you have to take care of. We all have to take care of. And you know, in the case of other countries including Mexico, they don't do that. It doesn't work that way. You don't walk over the border for one day and all of a sudden we have another American citizen. It doesn't work that way. Mexico doesn't do it. Other places don't do it. Very few places do it. We're the only place just about that's stupid enough to do it. So, I decided to run, I've gotten an amazing reception. I have to say, has this been crazy? I mean, it's been wild. I'm a non politician. The other day, I served jury duty. Right? I told you, they had occupation. I refused to put down politician. But I will say this: We have a great politician here. We have a man here who really have been, he's the one person I sought his counsel because he's been so spot on, he's so highly respected. Has anybody ever heard of Sen. Jeff Sessions? He was so great. Such a help. So, I go around and I see so many people and I've been treated so well by the people. And you know, we're leading in every poll. We're leading in just about every state, including Alabama. Big. We're leading in Florida. Could you believe it? We're leading big in Florida. And you know, it's really amazing. I said, Well Florida, I love Florida. It's a great place, right? Right. But Florida, we have a governor and we have a sitting Senator and I'm killing them. How do you explain that? Obviously they're not doing a very good job because that shouldn't be happening. But we're winning in Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas. And then, nationally, we're just absolutely way ahead of everybody else. In fact, you know, if this were another country, we could maybe call for an expedited election. Right? I would love that. Can we do that? Can we do that? I'd like to have the election tomorrow. I don't want to wait. So, the reason that I think we see this receptivity is that I know the game better than anybody. I've been on the other side. You know, I was totally establishment. Was handingmillions of dollars to these characters all the time, right? I was like the fair haired boy. Do I look fair haired? But I know the game. I mean, I understand it. And so many people have come up, lobbyists. I said I don't want money from lobbyists. But recently, last week, a man comes up who's a good guy. I know him. I said I don't want your money. I don't want your money because I don't know maybe I'll rethink it. Should I rethink it? Take it. You know what I should do? How about this? How about if I take his money but in the end, I screw him and don't do anything for him. Is that okay? Can I do that? You know, because I built a great business and I felt sort of stupid. I say I don't want your money. Can I take it please? I promise I won't do anything for him. I told him, I said, You know, I don't want your money because in two years when you come to see me about something I'm not doing it unless it's good and unless it's going to make America great again. Right? Right? But I'm going to have to rethink it. I think I'm going to rethink that because I think I should take a lot of money, are we allowed to give it to charity or something? I don't know. Just take it. Just take it. So what happens is these guys come up and I'm lucky. You know, everybody said he's never going to run. Okay? You know that. Right? And my wife actually said, You know, if you, she knows me pretty well and she also sees the reaction and for a long time whether it's Trump, The Art of the Deal, which Obama and Kerry obviously did not read when they did this crazy deal with Iran. Oh, look, the Art of the Deal. Give me that book. I love that book. You know, I said the other day and it sort of played pretty well that is my second, help her over here, give me that book. There's always the Art of the Deal and that's the real one; that's the original. That's when they use real paper right? You know, I said the other day because so many people they carry around the Art of the Deal because they're begging, they're begging their politicians Please, please read the Art of the Deal when you negotiate with China and with Japan and with Mexico and with Vietnam and with Saudi Arabia and with everybody. You know, right now we have a problem where North Korea's getting frisky. Right? Now, recently I ordered 4000 television sets. I'd like to order them from here. Like the hats made in America. Can you believe it? I was able to find a guy. I had to do that because you know these hats are hot as a pistol. You know that. And they're made in America. And I'm going to give you your book. Believe me, I haven't forgotten about you. But they're made in America. But the other day and now I see today it's sort of pretty hot on the news that our very dear friend North Korea is acting a little bit rambunctious again. So, I ordered 4000 television sets from South Korea, whether it's Samsung or Sharp or LG or any of them. They're all made in South Korea. I paid a fortune and they're wonderful. And they're wonderful people. They're making a fortune. We don't, do we have anybody who makes television sets in this country? I almost like don't think so, right? So they're mostly made, other than Sony, which has lost its way, prices are too high, but they're mostly made in South Korea. So now I see North Korea is acting up. So I see that we are sending ships and we're getting our troops ready. We have 28000 troops over there. And we're getting ready just in case. We're going to fight, we're going to protect. We get nothing. We get nothing. What do we get? We get nothing. Saudi Arabia, and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. But you know, Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day. A day. That's, in all fairness, that's before the oil went down a little bit. But that's okay. These are minor details. But, let's say they were, let's say they're making a half a billion a day. That's not so bad, right? We get nothing. And they wouldn't be there without our protection. Even Germany, Germany's a power. Who has a Mercedes Benz? Anybody? A lot of people. They're a power. They pay us nothing. We defend the whole world. All you have to do, and we want to be nice. Somebody said, Oh, that's like the mafia defense. I said, Don't worry about it, okay? The mafia's not so stupid. All right? They said, That's terrible to ask for money. No, they said it. They said that's terrible. How can you possibly ask for money to defend a country? I mean, tell me, tell me, how crazy are we? Now, we're sending our ships, we're sending our everything. We got, I'll tell you what. Those 28000 troops that we have right now on the border between North and South Korea. That's dangerous territory. They're in harm's way. They're in harm's way. And we get nothing. We get nothing. Other than they're a good competitor. I mean, they compete with us. They take our trade. We lose a fortune with them. We lose a fortune with China. We defend Japan. You know, we have an agreement with Japan where if somebody attacks Japan, we have to come to their rescue. But if we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Do you think that's a good deal? That's sort of like Sgt. Bergdahl. Has anybody heard of Sgt. Bergdahl? The traitor. No, no, the traitor. I call President Obama the five for one President. We get Sgt. Bergdahl, a traitor, who by the way six people at least that we know of, six people were killed trying to get this guy back. Six people, they went after him. They wanted to get him back. So we get Sgt. Bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted for years that are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? And you know, the reason we have crowds, and no matter where I go, the other night, we're in New Hampshire, we had some, New Hampshire was so incredible. The crowd. You saw it. You know, every time I go on television it's got to be live. It's live. I said, Oh, can I have a rest please? Tonight it's live on Fox. Who likes Fox? I like Fox. It's live on CNN. Who likes CNN? And it's live on MSNBC. Well, they're still working. But I said, How come it always has to be live? Why can't they just cover me like anybody else where they go the next day and they show a little clip? Every time I speak, it has to be live. It's ridiculous. But it's okay. Right? We have to suffer with it. But look, the reason I have this really incredible enthusiasm, and I really appreciate you especially with this weather and this heat and everything else, but the reason I have it is because I do know what I'm doing. And I don't say that in a braggadocious way. You people are looking for somebody that knows what he's doing. Whatever it is. I said it the other night, my second favorite book of all time, what's my first favorite book? The Bible. The Bible. And as much as I love the Art of the Deal, it's not even close. We'd take the Bible all the way, right? So, I was saying. So they said I wasn't going to run. And everybody said, Oh, he's never going to run. Never going to run. He's just having fun. Just a good time. His brand, Like I care about my brand. At this point, my brand, I mean, I lose gutless Macy's because I said about illegal immigration. They dropped my brand. They're not supposed to be, they're gutless. They're all gutless. I have to sue Univision. Univision, my poor Miss Universe people, these beautiful women, some are girls, but beautiful women and I get dropped. Think of it. You have these magnificent women who worked all their life to be in the Miss USA contest and the Miss, and two weeks before the contest, NBC and Univision dropped because they thought my tone was a little bit strong. And it turned out I was right. So here's the good news. I sued them both. And I mean, in the case of Univision, I sued them for $500 million. I want that money. I want that money. So I actually put it on the other day, Miss USA, I put it on because it was only fair to the people. And we had it in a small network and it was fun. But who would do that? All because they want to be so politically correct. They actually called and said, Oh, we'll get it back on soon. We'll get it back on soon. You know, in a case of a couple, they said Trump loses NASCAR. It was all over the world. A friend of mine called. You know, because I opened with a strong statement, meaning illegal immigration, we've got to solve the problem. So all over. One day it was NASCAR. Trump loses NASCAR. I said, I don't have a deal with NASCAR. It turned out that I lost NASCAR, you know what they did? They rented a ballroom at Trump Doral. Can you believe it? That was my loss. They had a ballroom. And by the way, I kept their deposit and rented it to somebody else. The next day, I didn't even know I had a deal with them. It turned out they had in one of my places. They're out. The next day ESPN severs ties with Trump. It's all over the world. ESPN, I have friends that called me. He's a great business. Oh, it's too bad about what happened to ESPN. You know what it was? A golf outing at one of my courses in Los Angeles. Can you believe it? This was my big deal. And this was all over the world. I mean, the press. I don't know. Maybe they didn't get it. Maybe they don't get it. I was very disappointed though with Macy's. You know, shirts and ties. It's not a big deal. But they heard they were going to be three pickets in front of the store and they called Oh, we're going to have pickets. We're going to have pickets. I said, Look, in two hours they'll be gone. Believe me, they'll go for lunch. They won't come back. Don't worry about it. It's true. But they said, Oh this is so bad. Can we sever ties? I said, I don't care, sever ties. I don't wear ties so much any more, you know. I didn't like the ties that much anyway. You know why? Because they were made in China. It always drove me nuts. True. But they were good. They were good. But I just hate gutless people. And so the reason that we're getting this receptivity, which is like this all over the place, is because I filed papers and they said I'm never going to run. Then they said I'm not going to sign the big document, which is a one page document which basically you're giving your life away and I signed. And then they said Oh, I can't believe it. The pundits, you know, they get paid a half a million dollars a year to sit there and make jerks out of themselves, right? Call them pundits. Some are great. Some are really incompetent. I could the ones but they're starting to get nicer to me so I think I can't. But what happens is they said He'll never file his financials. He'll never file because he's probably not as rich as people think. I said, Actually, one of the reasons I want to run is because I want to file my financials because they're so good. Because it's true. It's true. So I have like about 102 pages or 98 pages of stuff and they have all these boxes over $50 million, over $50 million. And I filed my financials and they were phenomenal. They were phenomenal. Much better. And people realized, and it was a net worth, and this is not bragging. I'm going to tell you why. Over $10 billion. That's good, right? Very little debt. Very little debt. In fact, to show you how stupid these people, it has a line for income and the income was like I think it's over $400 million a year. Is that good? My son is here. Look at Eric. He could live on that. It says a line, income and it's like, you know, varies with different things. But basically over $400 million a year. Is there anybody that would not want to make that much money in one year here? Well, with it comes responsibility but I will tell you this. The reason people like what I'm saying is because I want to put that energy, whatever the hell kind of energy it is, I don't know if it's screwed up, if it's good, if it's genius, if it's whatever it is, I know how to do things. And I'm not going to do, I don't care about, you know, we're building a great building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite, between, as you know, the White House and the Old Post Office. You know in real estate business slogan, Always get the post office because they were there first. I got the old post office in Washington, DC And I got it from the Obama administration. Can you believe that? Now, that's call dealmaking. One of the most sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration and I got it. And you know what? They did the right thing because we're doing a great job and we had a great statement. They wanted to make sure it gets done. And it will be opening, and here's a little story. It's now under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? And we just finished Doral and lot of great jobs. And my son is here, Eric Trump. And Ivanka. Has anybody ever heard of Ivanka? And I'll let them run it. I'm not going to let them do any big deals. Just relax, Eric. Just relax. Calm it. But you know what? I won't care about that company. My whole energy, who cares? We do a building. It doesn't mean anything. My whole energy, my whole being is going to be to make our country rich and to make our country great again. And I mean, it's my primary, it's my aptitude. I've always had an aptitude for making money. Some people would say That's nice. One person said, Mr. Trump, that's very crass. I said, Why? You said you were going to make the country rich. That's very crass. I said, You have to understand in order to make our country great, I have to make it rich again. We're a debtor nation. He agreed. So I will devote 1000%. I couldn't care less about the Old Post Office. I couldn't care less about any of our stuff. My kids are very good. They're going to run it very nicely. And I just want to make this country so great. And that's what's going to happen. And that's what's going to happen. In Alabama, US Steel, big closure. Or essentially a closure. And I said, Why? What happened? And I went around. And I said, Anybody work there? No, I don't think so. I hope not. But big closure. And one of the reasons is China is dumping so much steel into the United States and other countries also. But China, I love that sign. Look at that, huh? Wow. Wow. Oh, that's true So China is dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country. The government is subsidizing it. It's almost like they want us to just die. And they have no respect for us. And again, like Saudi Arabia, like Japan, I get along with them great. You know, the largest bank in the world is one of my buildings. They pay me rent. They buy apartments. They spend so much money. Am I going to dislike them? I love them. The problem is and I say it all the time. Their leaders are really smart. They're really cunning. They're really sharp. And we have dummies. Right? We have dummies. We have dummies. We have people that don't have a clue and I don't know. You know, some people say they're bad people. Well, I don't think they're bad people. I think they're incompetent people. A lot of people think they're bad. I don't think they're bad. I think they're incompetent. So you look at China and what they've done. And you know, last week and I said this and I've been saying bubble for a long time. You've been hearing it. Last week, they devalued their currency and we're having a lot of hard times because of what they did. And when I hear devaluation of the Chinese currency, you know the word, the sucking action. That's a sucking like the vacuum cleaner. I hear the sucking action. Two things happen. Two things get sucked out of us. Our jobs and our money. Now, think of it. China sells us our product, takes our jobs, takes our base, does our manufacturing for us, and we owe them $1 trillion. That's like a magic act. I call it the magic act in reverse. We owe them money. Japan, and Japan is back. They have Abe, who's the new prime minister. And Abe is really smart. I mean, he's smart. I met him one time. He's sharp. He's negotiating against Carolyn Kennedy. Carolyn. And I was watching 60 Minutes, I'll give you guys a plug, I was watching 60 Minutes and they're doing a feature on Carolyn Kennedy and she's very nice. You know why I like her? Because Ivanka Trump likes her. My daughter likes, anybody that my daughter likes, right? Anybody my daughter likes, we love Ivanka. So, what happens is that they're doing a feature and they said How did you become Ambassador to Japan? And with Japan, the Ambassador is a very important position because we negotiate. You know, you need somebody sharp. We need a killer. Right? A smart killer, not a dumb killer because there are plenty of dumb killers too. You need somebody sharp. So they said How did you get the Ambassadorship? She said, Well, and this is pretty close. You can check it out. Well, I don't know. I wanted a job and I had nothing to do. So I went to the White House and I said, 'Could I have a job? Do you have anything for me to do? And they said, How would you like to be Ambassador to Japan? And she said, Really? She said, I'll do it. She couldn't believe she got it. And then they showed the rest of the show as her being wined and dined by Abe and all of these killers. Wined and dined. She's being feted at dinner, at this, and lunches and breakfast. She'll do anything they want. Anything. So I have the smartest, toughest, meanest, in many cases, the most horrible human beings on Earth. I know them all. They're killers. They're negotiators. Some are nice people. Very few. Some are nice people. But I will put the meanest, smartest, we have the best in the world. We don't use them. We use political hacks, diplomats. We use people that don't have any business ability. We use people that have never done a job. You know, like as an example, Carl Icahn, did anyone ever hear of Carl? He's an unbelievably brilliant tough businessman. So I called him. I had dinner with him two nights ago. I said, You know, Carl, I'm doing pretty well. I'm leading every poll. He said, You're doing great. He can't believe it either. And I said, If I ever get there, I want you to oversee the negotiations with China and Japan. I'll do it. I'll do it. He's like I'll do it. Remember when I said somebody has blood come out of her eyes with hatred? Right? Well, he had blood coming out of it; he will do it. He is an unbelievable negotiator. An unbelievable negotiator. And I know others. I know the best. I know the worst. I know the ones that are overrated. I know the ones that you've never heard about or read about that are better than all of them. But Carl's one of the greats. I mean, he's very famous. He's very rich. And he would love to do it. He'd love to give back. And he knows what's happening. They're ripping us. So they send their stuff over here. And actually, somebody the other day said What China has done to the United States is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. Isn't is an interesting statement? We've rebuilt China. We've rebuilt China. So you know we have free trade. The problem with free trade is when you have free trade, very important, you need competent leaders. That's the one problem with free trade. I like free trade. I'm a free trader. The problem is you need great negotiators, great leaders. We don't have that. So we're getting killed by everybody. I use these three or four countries. We don't make good deals. Everybody's killing us. So we will have unbelievable deals. A friend of mine is a manufacturer, and he's trying to do business with China. And what he's going, and he's a great manufacturer. Makes great products. Better than what they did. They don't want him sending his stuff. And he calls me and he goes, You know, it's impossible to do business. I can't get my product, they're dumping stuff over here, comes in by the ship load. He said, It's impossible. I can't get my product, Finally gets a product in there and they charge him a massive tax which they call a tariff because it sounds a little more sophisticated, right? And he calls me. And he goes, It's impossible to do business with China. Boeing does business with China. And they want all of their intel. They want all of their copyrights. They want everything. Otherwise, we're not buying planes. And they're now building big factories, I don't blame China. I mean, I respect them. Not angry at them. I'm angry at our leaders for being so stupid. I'm not angry at China. And Mexico is the same thing. You know, Mexico is the new China. The other day, Nabisco, Nabisco. Oreos. Right? Oreos. I love Oreos. I'll never eat them again. Okay? I'll never eat them again. No, Nabisco closes a plant. They just announced a couple of days ago in Chicago. And they're moving the plant to Mexico. Now, why? Why? Why? Have you heard? My favorite story is with Ford So Ford, great company. They're building a $2 billion car factory in Mexico. Now, they're closing up places all over the United States. They're building this massive factory in Mexico. So I went to this great school. I was actually, you know, I was totally still am really smart. I went to this great place, the Wharton School of Finance, hardest school to get into. Even then it was hard to get into. The hardest. But I went to this great business school and I get business. And I fully understand. Really good at this stuff. So they're building a $2 billion plant. They're going to close up factories in the United States. They're going to go and build this plant, they're going to sell cars, they're going to sell them back to us, they're going to sell them. Where does that help us? Tell me. Explain. Explain. There's no tax. There's no nothing. There's no nothing. So we're closing plants here. They're building this massive plant in Mexico. Another plant. Also another big foreign car company. There was a plant being built. It was all set to get started. They were going to announce it in Tennessee. You read about it. And this was a couple of months ago. Wall Street Journal. All set to get started. All of a sudden, Mexico took it away. And now it's not going to be built in Tennessee. It's going to be built in Mexico. So Ford is building a plant. I give myself this position. And I say Let's assume that somebody else becomes President. Wouldn't that be horrible? Wouldn't that be horrible? So let's assume somebody else becomes President. Let's assume a very low energy person, very, very low energy. So low energy that every time you watch him, you fall asleep. Yeah, Hillary too. So let's say Jeb becomes President. Not good. Not good. First thing's that's going to happen, like I said, your school's going to hell. People flow over, but forget about that. So let's say that Jeb doesn't want this plant build. So they're going to call him, the head of Ford, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we want to build it. He'll say, Well, we don't want it built. The next day or the next hour, he's going to get a call from the lobbyists and the special interests and his donors and they're going to say, Hey Jeb, we gave you $8 million of your $120 million that you raised. We gave you $8 million. We want that thing done. You can't do that to our people. Oh, well, okay, I'll approve it. It's going to get done. Okay? The plant will get built and that would be it. Now, let's take Trump as President. Okay, is that better? Here's the simple question: Who would you rather have negotiating with China, Japan, Mexico, any other? Trump or Bush? Actually, ah, what a group. What a group. Well, you know, it's sort of interesting. CNN does this big report that came out last week that I was leading in the poll. So it's a poll. And everybody says why don't I have a pollster. What the hell do I need a pollster? Everyday I wake up there's another poll. Right? You know, they pay these guys like $100000 a month and they can't function because unless they go and have it vetted with their pollster, they can't talk. And I say, Why do I need a pollster when everyday there's a new poll and they give like 30 pages? I don't have to get a pollster. What the hell do I need it? But CNN did this very expensive, very well done poll. It's only well done because I was leading by a lot. And they had leadership. I was way ahead of everybody. They had actually I was very good in, you know the thing I'll be great atand I'll do very well at it, military. I am the toughest guy. I will rebuild our military. It will be so strong, so powerful and so great. It will be so powerful and so great that we'll never have to use it. Nobody's going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody's going to mess with us. So, I look at the various things to do with our country. And by the way, one of them, boy, we're going to take care of our vets. Right? Right? They did a poll but they did a poll on like who's one of the most popular with the vets? I was the most popular person. They like me. And I love them. Because you know why? Because for 35 years, these Senators and these, other than Jeff, of course. I take Jeff. But these Senators, these Congressmen, these people in Washington, including Presidents, they have done nothing for the vets. They have done nothing. And we're going to take care of our vets. But so they do this poll, and in the poll, I scored really high marks on almost everything other than, they thought I wasn't a nice person. They said who's the nicest and I was pretty low on that part. And I'm a nice person. But who cares? A woman came up to me and she said, I'm not choosing, you're not nice enough to be President. I said, You know what? This is not going to be an election based on a nice person. It's going to be based on a competent person. We're tired of the nice people. So, I won on the economy. I won on jobs. I won on leadership by massive numbers. Like massive. You've seen it. I won on all these categories. I said, Why do we need an election? We don't need an election. These are such important categories. But I have had an amazing experience because from the time I announced almost, other than the first week. That was a rough week. They were hitting me. But the press, which is by the way largely very dishonest. I have to say this. The political media, I actually think that the political media is less popular than Congress. Can you believe it? And Congress has almost no rating. And in all fairness, because look at all those cameras. They're all live and they're trying to shut off the camera right now. But you know what? They're all live. And so many live cameras. But I will say this. The media is very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while I'll get an honest story and I love it. I cherish those stories. They're not often. But I cherish those stories. They really started treating me much better. Don't forget, when I first ran, I said you know it's amazing. Went to a great school. Excellent student. Smart guy. My uncle was a professor at MIT who was a smart guy. You know, good smart guy. Good family. Do we believe in the gene thing? I mean, I do. Right? You know, I do But then I went out and built a tremendous fortune and great company. I did the Art of the Deal and many books that were bestsellers. The Art of the Deal is one of the biggest selling, maybe the biggest selling, business book of all time. I did The Apprentice. We love The Apprentice. Tremendous. NBC hates me. You know, NBC hates me because they renewed The Apprentice and I said, Excuse me, I'm not doing it. I'm running for President. I'm going to make the country great again. They actually came up to my office and the top people, great people from NBC, and they said, Please, please. They said We had already renewed the show. They had sold most of the advertising. They renewed the show. I said I'm going to run and I'm going to make our country great I'm hired. You're hired! So, I look at the landscape of our country. I look at where we're going. I look at where we've been. We've had a horrible number of years. A horrible number of years. We can't beat ISIS. I watched the general the other day on television, who's just retiring, which is fortunate. How do you think we'll do against ISIS? Oh, I don't know. It's going to be very tough. Can you believe this? General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their graves as you listen to this. They're spinning in their graves. He talks about a hard time. And I look at what's going on with the landscape and I get to meet all of the people that I've met over the last period of time and I want to tell you it's been amazing. It's been really amazing. And I want to finish up with a couple of little points. One of them is the Ford deal. Right? Israel, I love Israel. The bottom line on Ford, I love this story because, so when I get the call, I say, No, no, no. You're going to build in the United States. They're going to say No, we don't want to do that. I say, Let me tell you, sir, you're going to build in the United States. And I will be called by people but I will not have any of their money so I don't care. And they're going say, and I'll call them in and I'll say, Listen, here's the story. You're building $2 billion in Mexico. We're going to charge you a tremendous little 35% tax. 35%. And that tax is going to be for every car and every part and every truck that comes into the United States. And here's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing or sitting, they're going to come back to me the following day. I would say the following afternoon. Let's say 12And I don't need Carl Icahn. This one is too easy. And they're going to come back and they're going say, Mr. President, what you're doing to us is terrible. We will build in the United States. We will build the plant in the United States. 100%. And I'll say the same thing to Nabisco. It doesn't help us. It doesn't help us. When you look at what's going where Nabisco is closing and so many places are closing, when you look at the kind of money that these countries are making and I'm naming a few, I mean, so many countries, we don't have anything left. We're running on fumes. We're running on fumes. There's nothing here. When you look at what happens, they're so much sharper, they're so much smarter, and we're not going to have a country left. We need to have our borders. We need to make great deals. You know, the man in the back just shouted Israel. How would you like to be Israel right now? They relied on us. They're a voice of sanity. They're great people. And we have a deal that is so incompetent, so bad. Think of the deal. We make a deal. Our chief negotiator goes into a bicycle race at 73 years old. He falls, he breaks his leg. That was the good part of our deal. That was the only thing that happened. No, think of it. And I told people last week as I told this last week, I swear to you I will never, ever ride a bicycle at least in a race but I won't ride one anyways. But we have new thing that just came up in the deal. We know all about the 24 day period, right? But the 24 day period, that doesn't start, that clock doesn't start ticking for a long time. For a long time. So that could be forever. So if they're doing something, believe me, by the time we get there, But there's the all time great. First of all, why aren't they giving us back our prisoners? And second, can you believe this? And second of all, the other day it was determined that Iran in a very important section, maybe the most important, right?, is going to do their own policing. They are going to police and they are going to tell us We swear we're not building anything. It's so sad. It's so sad. Obamacare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We are going to come up with a plan and there are so many different ways. You know, you don't know this because you don't think of Obama this way. Do you know who the biggest beneficiaries of Obamacare are? The insurance companies. The insurance companies. Remember I told you special interests and lobbyists, the insurance companies love it. We can have such great plans if we'd get rid of the artificial lines around every state. I have a huge company, and when I negotiate, I like get one group. They don't, you can't negotiate. Some of the people that own businesses know what I'm talking about. The insurance companies are so protected, they're making a fortune. We're going to end that. We're going to make it so competitive. We're going to get rid of the artificial barriers. You're going to get such great plans. And Obamacare, I mean, you look at what's happening with your premiums. I mean, look at this. Look at what's happening. Just take a look at what's happening to the deductibles. They're so high, it's impossible. It's impossible. Trade, we're going to fix it. Health care, we're going to fix it. Women's health issues, we're going to fix it. My wife came up to me the other day and she said It's really sad because people don't understand how you cherish women. I will protect women. It's so important to me. So important. And I heard some of the other candidates, Jeb and some of the others the other day, saying we're not going to fund various women's health issues. Can you believe this? I said, That's the end of his election. Women, I don't think, like that too much. Do we agree? And he said, we're not going to fund women's health issues. A few hours later, he came back and he said he misspoke. Oh, okay. He misspoke. But women's health issues, so important. We're going to end up taking our country. We are going to make it so strong, so powerful, so loved by people again, so loved. You know, one of the problems that we have and you don't see it tonight but you see it is the tremendous lack of spirit. And I actually thought that President Obama, the one thing, he was inexperienced, he never produced a job. Lots of other things. But I actually thought that he would be a great, a really great cheerleader for the country when he was elected. I thought that he would. And he's really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great unifier. Really had. And you look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis last night over the last week, you look at all of the things that are happening. We're sitting on powder kegs. There's no spirit. There's no jobs. There's no anything. We are going to take this country. I am going to be the greatest jobs President that God ever created. I will tell you that. I will tell you. You are going to be so proud. You know, I oftentimes say the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger and more powerful than ever before. And that's what's going to happen. I am going to make this country bigger and stronger and better. And you're going to love it and you're going to love your President. And we're going to turn this place around and you're going to be so proud. And you know our whole theme is make America great again. We are going to make America better than it's ever been and we're going to love doing it and we're going to have fun doing it. And I just want to thank everybody because this has been really, really special. Thank you. Thank you very much! Thank you very much. Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. Thank you Well, it's just, it's going to be very exciting for the kids and I know that the kids are going to go up. We have quite a few children who are going to take rides today. So, where are the children? Get them over here. That's great. I love children. I love Iowa. Great place. I've really developed a relationship with it, and it's an amazing place. Well, I've been doing it. You know, I've been here many times, as you know. And we have a great staff with the whole place. I mean, Chuck and everybody. So I've really been doing it. And actually the venues have gotten larger and larger because we've really gotten some tremendous crowds. We're doing record breaking crowds. And I'm so honored when I saw the recent polls with Iowa, leading by a lot. But we have actually, and we started with the smaller venues and we've gotten bigger and bigger. The crowds have gotten to be enormous actually. I would still do that if it was appropriate. I love my kids. Come here, kids. Does anybody want to take a ride? Looks nice, right? They're going to have a great time. It's a great experience. I do. I have jury duty. Can you believe this? I look forward to it, actually. I have no expectation. I just hope they're innocent. Whoever it is, I hope they're innocent. Well, she's got a lot of problems with the email situation. It's a big problem. If you look at Gen. Petraeus, he had just a tiny fraction of what she's got going and they destroyed his life virtually. So I think she's got some very big problems. I wish her luck but I think she's got some big problems. It would look that way to me. I don't know. I always say you're innocent until proven guilty. But certainly it would look that way. It looks very serious as far as Hillary's concerned. I hope that's not what happens to her but certainly the facts aren't looking for her right now. And if you look at Gen. Petraeus, what he went through on a much lesser level, is I think it's going to be very tough for her. I don't even want to talk about that question. That's a very serious question. And hopefully, you would never have to use a nuclear weapon. Hopefully. But we have to be prepared. Look, the world hates us, probably never like this before. And we have to build up our military. We have to take care of our vets. And we have to have the finest armament. We have to have the finest military and equipment anywhere in the world by a factor of 10. We have to be protected. We have to be so tough and so strong and so smart that nobody will ever mess with us. I'd say hello. Well, we've done so well because people hear my message. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world whether it's China, or Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade in the case of Mexico. Mexico is sort of becoming the new China in terms of trade. So many companies, just yesterday I read where Nabisco, Nabisco is moving to Mexico. I mean, give me a break. So we have to reverse that. We need jobs in our country. We don't have to worry about other countries. We're going to take jobs back from China, Japan. We're going to make our country great again. And that to me is going to be the challenge. And we're going to do it and it's not going to be that difficult. I spoke with Carl Icahn. He's a friend of mine. He's a great negotiator. He will help us. All of the best negotiators, we have the best business people in the world in this country. They'll all help us. And believe me, when I get the right people negotiating with the right countries, we will come out on top every single time. And that's what we need. Well, Jeb Bush is a puppet to his donors. There's no question about it. He's got lobbyists. I know that. He's got lobbyists and you know he made statements over the last couple of days that are incredible trying to justify the war in Iraq. Can't be justified. And then he said skin in the game. I don't know if you saw his recent statement. He said the United States has to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game. We've spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and he said we have to prove that we have skin in the game. I think it maybe one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard. Skin in the game. We don't have to prove anything. First of all, the Iraqi officials are a bunch of crooks, if there's even an Iraq which I don't think there is. Iran is taking over Iraq. It was one of the dumbest things ever. And I think what happened because I understand psychology, I think his brother probably said Hey, you're killing me. That was his war and he looks very bad. So Jeb Bush tried to push back. But when he said we have to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game and we've lost all of those lives and all of that money, I think he should apologize to the families of the people. I was one of the greats. But now I'm on the different side. I know how the system works better than anybody. Many of the people that gave to Jeb and to Hillary and to everybody else, they're friends of mine or enemies of mine but they're people I know. These are not people that are doing it because they like the color of his hair, believe me. These are highly sophisticated killers. And when they give $5 million or $2 million or $1 million to Jeb, they have him just like a puppet. He'll do whatever they want. He's their puppet. Believe me. And with me, I had yesterday a lobbyist called me up. It's a friend of mine. Good guy. Smart as hell. He's, for his client, I don't blame him. He said, Donald, I want to put $5 million into your campaign. I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. He said, No, no, I want to put $5 million in. I said, I don't want it because when you come back to me in two years and you want help for a company you're representing or a country that you're representing, I'm going to do the right thing for the people of the United States and I don't want to have to insult you. So honestly, I appreciate it. I don't want your $5 million. I'm turning down so much money. But if he put it up, I'd feel obligated because I'm a loyal person just like Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush and all of them. I'm not just talking about Jeb Bush. Hillary too. Believe me. Nobody played the game better than I did. I know the game from the other side and that's the way it works. Nobody else will do the job that I will do. I will bring back jobs. I will strengthen our military. I'll take care of our vets. I'll get rid of Obamacare, which is by the way a catastrophe. Look at what's happening with your, no, look what's happening. Look what's happening. The cost of your insurance is going through the roof. Look what's happening. It's terrible. I will take care of people. And I will be better to women. It's another thing. I heard with Jeb, women's health issues he didn't want to fund. Then he goes back two, three hours later and he said oh he misspoke. He misspoke? I will be so great to women. I cherish women, and the women haven't been take care of properly. When I hear somebody like Jeb Bush talking about we're not going to fund, then he comes back because you know his pollsters said You made a mistake. You have to go back and take it back. But he doesn't mean it from the heart. Well, you're going to have to be very forceful action. Very, very forceful action. You cannot let Iran, let me just tell you this, nor can Israel. Israel was sold out by Kerry and Obama. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. You can't have it. When they march down the streets saying Death to Israel, Death to the United States. You can't let it happen. It will not happen. Believe me, it will not happen here. It's irrelevant. Well, you saw I make $400 million a year. So what difference does it make? What I want to do is I want to make the country great. That's all I want to do. That's much more important. My businesses have been so successful. My children are my executives who will run that easily. I won't even think about, I won't even care about it. My sole focus will be taking that brain that built a great business with some of the great assets of the world. I have some of the great assets, Turnberry in Scotland, Doral in Miami, I have some of the greatest assets in the world. Best locations in Manhattan. Trump Tower, 57th and Fifth. That's what I do. That whole, whatever it is, whatever kind of a brain that is will be used to making our country rich again. Trade deals, great trade deals. Making our country rich. And then making it great. We can't make it great unless we make it rich. We have to bring back the money. We're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. So, my whole focus will be this country and making it great. I would do that, yeah, if I had to. Yes, I do. I have the exceptions and I've been open about that. I don't think I've made mistakes. I mean, every time somebody says I made a mistake, they do the polls and my number goes up. So I guess I haven't made any mistakes. Look, when I said Mexico is sending, I was talking about illegal immigration. The people understood it even though the press didn't want them to. My numbers went up. When I talked about John McCain, I was saying how bad he's treated the veterans because the veterans are treated badly. Then they do a poll. Who do you like better, to the veterans, John McCain or Trump? And I swamped him in the poll. The veterans like me better because they know I'll take care of them. He hasn't taken, after 30 years, he hasn't taken care of them. And this last thing with Fox. I mean, I love Roger Ailes. But all you have to do is ask Roger Ailes Who won? So I don't think I made any mistakes. I'm sure I will at some point. But so far, you would have to say Has it worked out badly? Right? That one I haven't heard. That won't happen. She's fantastic though. I'm going to do a lot of things. Almost everything. You want to know what things am I going to do different for this country? Almost everything because that's what has to happen. Everything we do is wrong. The military, we're not taking care of the military. Not taking care of our vets. We're not taking care of our country. We're not taking care of our finances. We're not taking care of our trade deals. When was the last time you saw this country have a victory? We don't have victories. We don't have victories against China in trade. China just devalued their currency. That's the sucking sound. You know what that is? That means jobs and money coming out of our country. What they did with that devaluation, the biggest devaluation they've had in two decades. They're killing us. They won't be doing it when I'm watching. And I think our people have no idea what's happening This is absolutely unbelievable. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. So this began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix. And the hotel called us up and they said, Please don't do it here. We're going to be swamped. It's going to destroy the building. It's been amazing. And outside, sadly, we have thousands of people that can't get in. So you know real estate. You know real estate. I want to thank everybody. You know, last night, and a lot of you saw it on television, it was actually carried live, we had an amazing event and a very sad event. And yet, very beautiful. Because the word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to. We have a situation that's absolutely out of control. We have incompetent politicians, not only the President. I mean, right here in your own state, you have John McCain. I just hate to see when people don't have common sense, don't have an understanding of what's going on, or perhaps don't want to know. Maybe it's campaign contributions. Maybe it's special interest. Maybe it's lobbyists. But for some reason, some people don't get it and I don't think they'll be in office much longer. I really mean that. We are going to make this country so great again. We are going to work so hard. And I will say this: When we had our event last night, I saw hardened veteran reporters who were crying. You had to see this. People that I've known for a long time that I don't even like, they're not good people. How are you doing back there? And one in particular, tears are streaming down his face and I'm saying, I don't believe what I'm seeing. I didn't think he had a tear in him. And some of the people that spoke were absolutely amazing. One, their child was killed by an illegal immigrant, shouldn't have been here. And this began for me, it's very interesting because when I started and when I announced, don't forget, everybody said, He's never going to run. Right? Then they said very strongly, you know, these are very knowledgeable people; they don't know anything. Then they said, He'll never file his FEC paper. I filed that two weeks ago. They said, Oh, wow. Then they said, He'll never file his financials because he's not as rich as people think. And they get filed during this week. And by the way, some of the other candidates will not be filing from what I hear. Okay? And when they filed, the number is actually much higher than anybody ever knew. And I'm not saying that to brag. I'm only saying that because that is the kind of thinking our country needs. We need thinking where trade deals with China, with Japan, with India, with everybody. We're getting ripped. We're being taken apart piece by piece, slowly. Slowly. China laughs at us. They laugh at our stupidity. They laugh at our incompetent politicians. They have geniuses negotiating for them. We have people who don't have a clue; they don't have a clue. Mexico, and by the way. Officially, and I've only said this about 200 times but it never gets reported. I love the Mexican people. I love the spirit of the Mexican people. I love them. Many, many people from Mexico, legal. They went in the old fashioned way. They're legal. Many, many people from Mexico work for me. And over the years, thousands of people, Hispanics, have worked for me. And many, many work for me now by thousands. They're incredible people. By the way, nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says that. They always cut that out. And I'll go a step further. I respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders, and they're killing us at the border and they're killing us in trade. They're killing us. And every once in a while I'll see a rally and it's put up by the Mexican government in my opinion. People come in. They're so perfect. They're like central casting. And you know how long the rallies last? Like about 12 minutes. They go home. But when you do, I've said this often. It's very, very hard for a very successful person, and I've heard it from the time I was a little boy, to run for President or even political office. And I find it and I have headlines everyday. ESPN drops Trump. A friend of mine in Paris called. Oh Don, it's too bad about ESPN. You know what they were doing? They rented my golf club for a day. They put up a big deposit. I took their deposit. And then I rented it to somebody else. I made two for the price of one. No, it's true. Then the next day all over the world, NASCAR drops Trump. NASCAR. NASCAR. And then friends of mine call up from Europe. Headlines, NASCAR. Don, it's too bad about NASCAR. I feel so, You know what that one was? They rented a banquet hall at Trump National Doral in Miami for one evening. I took their deposit, I took their deposit. And you know what? I just rented it for much more money than they were paying. So it's two for the price of one. You know, I may make money running for President. It's very interesting. Then all over the place, I hear Macy's. Now, Macy's hurts because the head of Macy's I thought was a great friend of mine, Terry Lundgren. Nice guy. He called me up, and I'm in New Hampshire and I'm getting ready to go on to make a speech. Sort of interesting. It's like 6:30 in the evening, and I get a call from Terry Lundgren of Macy's. And the speech is packed. It was a house. It was supposed to be in the house. They didn't have enough room. They had 300, 400 people and they never thought this was going to happen. They thought there were going to be 30 like this. This is a little larger but the same thing proportionally. So my phone rings, my cell phone, and it's Terry Lundgren of Macy's. And the man on stage is getting ready to introduce me. And he said, And you know, we have Donald Trump, the American dream and blah, blah, blah, blah, everything. And my phone rings during the introduction. I'm going to be going up there like in a minute. And he goes, Donald, hi. He's like my best friend. I said, Terry, what's your problem? He said, You're very controversial. He said, and I'm supposed to be going up. I'm supposed to make a speech. I got all these people. And by the way, cameras, just like all these cameras, you have all these cameras, we're on live television all over the place like we are now. And he said, Donald, I had calls from Hispanic people saying they're going to boycott Macy's. I don't know what to do. I said, Terry, be tough. They'll be gone. One day, one day. Now, this is a man I played golf with. I'm with him all the time. I mean, really was, was, was, you understand, because I don't forget things He said to me, Please, please, Donald. Can I cut you? It's not a big deal. I'm selling ties. And honestly, you know what? They were made in China so I didn't care that much. I was like screw it. So I'm walking up the stairs to make a speech and I have Lundgren saying I'd like to cut you because he's going to get some bad publicity, he thinks. And I walked upstairs and he said, And now the American dream. And I'm still talking to Lundgren, and it's like a minute and a half before I walk on stage. People said, What happened? And I made a good speech. No notes. No nothing. And everybody was happy. And I just got cut from Macy's. And here's the bottom line on Macy's. Thousands and thousands of people are cutting up their Macy's credit card. Thousands. Then I get a call from NBC. Now, let me tell you about NBC. No, no, I got to tell you. Hey, look, I love the people at NBC. We had a tremendous success with The Apprentice. And they renewed The Apprentice. See? I give up a lot. You're going to see how much money I made with The Apprentice come Wednesday or Thursday when I do my filing. Seriously. It's a very lucrative, you know, it's great when you have a big television show. It's like, you know, you're a movie star; you get a lot of money. Right? Not that much but a lot. But you're going to see very impressive numbers. So NBC calls me, We'd like to see you. Now, they don't care about inclusion. They were talking about inclusion. You know, they write their press release. So, I read this and I say, This is incredible. But they called me and a couple of months ago the head of NBC comes to see me. And the head of NBC's boss, I don't want to mention names because they're really good people. They're friends of mine although I'll probably never speak to them again either. And you know, the head of NBC's boss, that's Comcast because they own NBC. So I get a call, the head of reality for NBC, the head president of NBC, and the head of everything, the head of Comcast. And they come to see me a number of months ago, Please do The Apprentice. Please. They won't deny it. They won't deny it. I said, I can't. I want to make America great again. I've done The Apprentice now for 12 years and it's a great show. For 12 years. There have 14 or 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every one have failed. Every single one. I mean, I could give you names but I don't want to embarrass people. Nah, give you a couple of names. No, nice people. Mark Cuban did one called The Benefactor. It was a disaster. Richard Branson did one. Great guy but it didn't work out. Tommy Hilfiger, who I love. A tenant in my building. Great guy. Didn't work out. Hiltons did one. Martha Stewart did one for us. Did one for Mark Burnett and Donald Trump. Martha Stewart. She'd just got out of the can. No, it's true. She's hot as a pistol. You know, they showed her coming out. You know, she's got the whole thing with the whole outfit that she's wearing. The whole thing. I said, What a great idea. So we actually did The Apprentice done by us. It wasn't even a copy. It was called The Apprentice. Within a couple of shows it was over. It was over. So I must have something, right? I must have. So here's the story. NBC sees this. I mean, they're smart people. So NBC comes to my office and they want me to do The Apprentice so badly. And what do I do? I said, I can't. I'm going to run for President. And I said, Because of equal time, Now, you know what equal time. Such a stupid law. Obama can go on television all day long and be President and run for office. But if I have a television show, what happens is everybody running for office would have to be able to do The Apprentice. Equal time. So you'll have a good guy named Rick Santorum. You'll have all these guys. You'll have somebody who used to head up Lehman Brothers, the governor from Ohio. Headed up Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers almost took down the world. He was a managing partner. I think he's a nice man. I don't know. But I know if you're the managing partner of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers almost, you're not looking too good. You know. But all of these guys, they would have to be given two hours in primetime television on Monday or Sunday night. I don't think so. So they came to my office and they said, We'd like you to do it. So important. And by the way, they renewed The Apprentice. It was really very interesting because a lot of people said, Well, how could, at the upfront, they announced The Apprentice, which is good because I always want to be loved, you know? Like when I went on dates, if a woman dropped me, which happened often, I would always like to say or at least in my own mind that I dropped her. Does that make sense? So what happened, makes me feel better. So they renewed The Apprentice and I said I'm not going to do it because I'm going to run for President. They didn't believe me. I said, Why won't you believe me? Why would you give up a primetime show? Mark Burnett calls from, a great guy. Survivor, Apprentice. Great guy. He really is a wonderful guy and a friend of mine. He calls me, he goes, Donald, they're giving you an extension. Nobody turns down an extension. He said, I've never heard of it before. I said, Mark, I'm going to run for President. Nobody believed me. Then I run. And the guys, they're in my office and they said Run and then by September, we'll do something. Do you believe that? Do you believe that? And I said, well if I don't do well, I would have done that. You know, why not? You know, if I'm not doing well, if it's obvious I'm, there's a problem. We just went to number one in the polls. So, NBC went nuts. They renewed their show and they don't have their star and everybody else failed with similar shows. And they're angry at me. So again, don't believe the inclusion. They've got Rev. Al Sharpton working for them. Okay? He's actually not a bad guy. He's a con man. You'd have to understand it. Rev. Al is a con man. You know, tells people I'm going to picket you if you don't give. I mean, this guy is a con man. But I've known him for 20 years. He's fine. You've got to understand who you're dealing with. They've got lying Brian Williams. He's okay. They sent me the most beautiful present a couple of months ago. Hundreds of, I shouldn't say the name because I deal with all of them, but in this case, Titleist. They sent me hundreds and hundreds of Titleist golf balls. Top of the line. They sent them to me. Card, From your friends at NBC. A short time later, they say He's not inclusive, me. I'm more inclusive than anybody. More inclusive than anybody. I then get a call. Univision. Now, Univision controls and by the way, believe me. Univision has a certain power. Now, I didn't know much about Univision. I thought they were very wealthy. They're actually not wealthy at all. They're highly over levered. They've got like, I think, $10 billion in debt. They have to do an IPO. Now, how stupid is this? They could have waited a couple of weeks, done their IPO, and be done. Instead, they do it early. They couldn't do it fast enough because you know why? In my opinion, it's only my opinion, the Mexican government totally tells Univision, it's about 80% of their market, totally tells Univision what to do. Totally. So the Mexican government is not happy with me, to put it mildly. But again, I respect Mexico but their leaders are too smart for our leaders because we have stupid leaders. Okay? And I'll tell you, just between you, just between this little bit of a group, thank you very much So the Mexican government does not care about the border nearly as much as they care about the bad trade deals that the United States is making with Mexico. That's really what it's all about. That's really what it's all about. So, I just sued Univision for $500 million. With all of that being said, we have to be strong. We have to take our country back. We have to run the country properly. So, I'm going to bring up a man who's a great man. He's a great, great guy. I saw him the other day on television. Don't worry. It's okay. You can shout. I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here; I think so. Because I'm telling you, I tell about the bad deals that this country is making. Mexico, I respect the country. They're taking our jobs. They're taking our manufacturing. They're taking our money. They're taking everything, and they're killing us on the border. And Mexico does not like it. So remember this. Don't worry. We'll take our country back very soon. Very soon. So the other day, you know it's funny, I got a great review for a speech, including my opening speech when I announced I'm running for President. It wasn't until five days later that people started saying, Oh he said something, What they don't say is they cut it in the middle of the sentence. They cut it. Because those people, many of them, not all, some are great, but many of them are very dishonest people, meaning the press. Very dishonest. Very dishonest. I'll give you one quick example because I want to bring somebody up for a second who's fantastic. But I'll give you one quick example. I say, and it's fairly standards because I believe it strongly, The American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger and better than ever before. Right? Right? So and I say it usually once during a speech, every once in a while. You know, I don't use teleprompters like the President and I speak from the heart. So I say The American dream is dead but I'm going to make it, it's standard, bigger, better, and stronger. Okay, so now I go home and my wife says to me, Darling, that was such a tough statement. What? I turned on the television. The American dream is dead. Period. Cut. I said, Oh, what a horrible statement. They are so dishonest. They are so dishonest. You know, what I usually do because if you really love this country, you have a very, very hard convincing people what you're doing is right and that you're really smart. And like a lot of us are really smart. I'm like really smart. Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then a long time ago, like the hardest or one of the hardest schools to get into. Did well at the school. Came out, made a fortune. Wrote a book called The Art of the Deal. Did everybody read The Art of the Deal? They say the number one selling business book of all time, which I agree, but I'll say one of them because if I'm slightly off by two copies, they'll say Oh, Trump exaggerated. Wrote many bestsellers. Many. I think 12. So I did a lot of things. But The Art of the Deal was like the number one selling business book of all time. Great. Then I do The Apprentice, became this tremendous hit. NBC was desperate to have it. Forget it. Now, they can put somebody else that lasts. Okay. So ready? And then I hear like Donald Trump doesn't deserve to be on the same stage with some failed Senators, failed governor or something. It's sort of amazing, isn't it? Isn't it amazing? And the poll just came out and I'm tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, Oh that's too bad. How can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible! He's weak on immigration. You know, the sanctuary cities. Did you know that he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can believe this? I didn't know that, I just, five of them. He's totally in favor of Common Core, meaning your children in Phoenix and other places are going to be educated by bureaucrats from Washington, who for the most part just want to pick up a check. Give me break. And he's in favor. I don't see him as a factor and I know it's the Bush name, which you know has gotten us into lots of wars. I mean, in all fairness, not the greatest. But Jeb Bush, I don't get it. So when they said, Mr. Trump, you're in first place. Oh that's good. You're tied with Jeb Bush. I said, That's not good. How can I be tied with this guy? But I'll tell you what, I'm going to bring up a man to just a few words. His son was viciously and violently shot by an illegal immigrant. His son was a star athlete, a star student. He applied to Stanford and many great colleges. He would have been, he could have gone anywhere. And I met Jamiel on television about a week ago. I see this guy. He's mentioning my name. I said, Oh no, not again because I figured he's killing me like everybody else. Right? My wife said, No, I think he's saying some really good things. I said, I doubt it. You know, they're hitting me left, right. I said, I doubt it. But I turned it up and he said, The only man that's sticking up for us is Donald Trump. This guy is great, and we were at the news conference with his mother and his sister yesterday and it was one of the most incredible things. So I'd like to introduce to speak a little bit about his son and how incredible his son was and how his son should be here with us. I mean, his son should be alive and he should be in one of the great colleges and he should be maybe someday in the NFL. But he won't be because an illegal immigrant shot him violently. And this guy is the best guy. He's become my friend. He's been with me for a few days. And just say a few words about your boy. By the way, Jamiel's sister is here too and she told me the story that when Jamiel saw the boy, saw the boy laying on the sidewalk dead, this incredible young man with such a future, Jamiel laid down on the sidewalk and started pounding the sidewalk with his hand and badly damaged his hand. Badly, badly. He couldn't understand it. He couldn't believe it. Just an amazing guy. I mean, just an amazing guy. And he wasn't being heard. He wasn't being heard. And the only reason I heard him was because he was talking on a show and he was mentioning how badly they've all been treated. And then you have in San Francisco, a beautiful young woman, Kate, and killed by somebody that just pleaded innocent. First pleaded guilty. Now he has a good lawyer and went into court and pleaded innocent. And they'll be playing around with him for about 15 years in court and probably he'll get off too. It's a horrible thing that's going on with our country. And these are two people that should be alive. And these are people that shouldn't have been in this country. They flow in like water. And I love legal immigration. I love it. I love it. I think it's great. My wife is a legal immigrant. I mean, she went through a whole long process. It's not easy, and we should maybe make it easier and faster, which I think is fine. And we'll have great people come in, and we'll have them come in from all countries, Mexico, everybody, every place. These are great people. And you know, one of the things that I've seen, because this has been an amazing week, and you know, it's been like an incredible week because I thought I was going to be the jobs person because every poll, CNN did a poll the other day, I'm killing everybody on jobs. I'm killing everybody on leadership. You know, it's like funny. You know, I went through these different categories, the only thing I'm not killing, a lot of people don't like me. I said what difference does it make. This is about competence. Somebody said, You win on leadership by far. You win on absolute economic, financial, anything having to do with the economy. You're like lapping the field. Much, much higher than anybody else. But they said, but a lot of people don't know whether or not they like you. I'm actually a nice person. But I actually said if I'm winning in all these categories, why are we even going through primaries? Hillary Clinton is going to be a horrible President. It's horrible. If she even wins her own primary, which I don't know. And by the way, just so you understand, even then press will say This crowd today blows away anything that Bernie Sanders is having. That I could tell you. But if you think about it, Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. The worst. The world blew up around her. Our enemies are a disaster and they hate us more. Our friends are all gone. They're all gone. They're all sort of like, we don't get along with anybody. Everybody is ripping us off, whether it's Russia or China. You know what we've done? For 20 years, I've heard the worst thing that could happen would be if Russia or China start uniting. We united them because we did things that were very onerous, because Obama doesn't like Putin and Putin doesn't respect or like Obama. And all of a sudden, Russia and China now are doing all sorts of things together. So we've driven them together and I've always heard that's a disaster, and it is a disaster. We have driven them. So, Hillary Clinton was the worst. Now, tell me something, why? Just tell me why would she be a good President? She'd be terrible. Who would you rather have negotiating a deal, a trade deal, with anybody? Trump or Hillary? Well, we have to get there first. So, who would you rather have negotiating a really good deal with Mexico, China, Japan? Trump or Jeb Bush? So, when I started, I really thought it would be, you know, a long slog, and I was okay with it. I didn't think that the immigration thing would take on a life like it has. I made some very tough statements about people flowing through because that's one of the things to make our country great again we have to create borders, otherwise we don't have a country. So it's one of many things. And I've been very strong. It's one of many things. We have to make great trade deals and all. So I said strong borders, one of the things. I said trade deals. Who would do better? I'll tell you what. I know the greatest negotiators in the world. Some are horrible people; horrible human beings. Who cares? Some Wall Street guys, they're brutal, they're miserable. You wouldn't want to go out to dinner, they're terrible people. I love them. I know the best. I know people that are totally overrated. They're not good like they think and like the press thinks. I know people that you never heard of that are better than all of them. I would take one, put him in charge of Japan. Good luck. You know who's our primary representative right now? Caroline Kennedy. You know how she got the job? 60 Minutes, she went to the White House. She said I'd love to have a job. I have nothing to do. They said, How would you like to be the Ambassador to Japan? She goes, Really? And Abe from Japan, who's a killer, he's great. He's already knocking the hell out of the yen, by the way, which makes it even more impossible for us to compete. And he's wining and dining her, and I watch it all the time, wining and dining and just doing a number on our country. A friend of mine is a great excavator. That's what he does. He digs foundations. He digs lots of dirt, Earth. But he's a great excavator. Big. And he always bought Caterpillar. And he calls me up recently and he goes, I'm a little depressed. Why? I just put in a big order for machinery, for excavating equipment. I said, Oh, that's good. Did you buy Caterpillar? No, I bought Komatsu. I said, You bought Komatsu? It's fine. I mean, it's a well known brand. I said, You bought Komatsu. Why? He said, Because Japan has so devalued the yen, brilliant, smart, these are smart people, that it made it impossible. So he ordered Komatsu instead of Caterpillar. This is happening all over the place. Today, in the Wall Street Journal, big story, Ford going to build tremendous plants all over the place overseas. Ford, by the way, speaking of Mexico. Again, I respect them. I wish we had smart people. Ford is building a $2 billion plant. Whoever heard of this? $2 billion in Mexico! So, I'm saying to myself, That's not good. And in addition to that in Tennessee, a big plant, $1 billion, was going to be built in Tennessee. Wall Street Journal. And all of a sudden at the last moment they decide to go to Mexico. It's going to be build down in Mexico by a big German car company. And Tennessee is great and the people were good. They all thought they had it, and at the last moment, it goes to Mexico. So I said to myself, Wow, $2 billion. And they're going to make cars and trucks and parts, and they're going to send them into the United States, no tax, no nothing. Now, I told you, I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was like, I'm like a really smart person. My uncle, Dr. John Trump, was at MIT, one of the smartest people. Great engineer. Great, like you know, smart. Right? For many years he was at MIT. And I'm saying to myself, Where does this help us for Ford to build a plant in Mexico and then sell, without tax, no tax? All that means is one thing, that we don't build a plant in the United States, whether it's in Phoenix or anywhere, because it's being built in Mexico. So I said to myself, Okay, Jeb Bush is President and he knows this is the wrong thing. Right now, we have Obama. He won't call. He doesn't even call to get our hostages back from Iran. Here we are in the middle of a deal and he doesn't call about that. One sentence, I'd say, Before we start, we've got to get those people back. Used to be three, now it's four. Get those people back. They'd be back the next hour. We need the right messenger. The Iran deal is a disaster. The Iran deal is a disaster. They are begging. Our chief negotiator at 73 is in a bicycle race. He falls and breaks his leg. This is the mentality we have. So I said, What would Jeb Bush do? You're right. Benghazi. Another Benghazi. To hear our politicians, John McCain, two days, Oh, Benghazi! You don't hear about it anymore. Hillary Clinton with the emails, Oh the emails!, two days. I'm more disappointed in the Republicans in many ways. They talk and talk and talk. So, Jeb Bush, let's say he's President, ay, ay, ay, so let's say Jeb Bush is President. He knows it's no good to have a $2 billion plant built right near our country. How does it help us, right? So here's what happens. He knows it's no good. He'll have a little pressure. Don't let the plant be built. And he might even say, Don't let the plant be built. Might even call the head of Ford. The plant's not going to be built. And then the next day, he'll be called by special interests that supported him, his lobbyists who push him around like a piece of candy, or his donors who have stock in Ford. And they'll say, You can't do that. I helped you. You can't hurt them. You just can't do it. He folds in about two seconds. So let me say Trump is President. Let me say Trump. So I don't need anybody's money. Actually, people are setting up PACs all over the place. I don't care. If they want to give it to me, I'll take it. Okay? But I don't need money. I don't want money. So I'm doing my own. You'll see that on Thursday or whatever the hell day I file. You'll see I did really well. Much better than anyone ever thought. Just the opposite. So here's the story. So Trump is President. So I get a call from the head of Ford and I'll say, You got to build in the United States. Sorry. He'll say, But Mr. President, really, we don't want, I'll say, Here's the story. Number one, congratulations on your new plant in Mexico. And number two, we're going to charge you 35% for every car, truck, and part you send over. And here's what would happen, here's what would happen. Now, this isn't like 99% sure. This is 100%. In fact, you know the negotiators, the killers that I told you about, these bad people? I wouldn't even bother calling them because this is too easy. I can just do this like, you know, with a couple of phones. So here's what would happen with Trump. I will get some calls. He will say Mr. President, this is terrible. Please! Please! Sorry, can't do anything. Sorry, I don't care. I want you to build here. I want jobs in the United States. So, they would go and they'd call up the lobbyists. Hey, I hire lobbyists. I have lobbyists all over the place. They're great. I want something, go do this. I know the system better than anybody. I'm a donor. Somebody said, Oh, you gave to the Democrats. Of course, I give to them. I give to everybody. I want to get everything done. Everybody loves me. Everybody loves, I give to everybody. Now, in a lot of ways, that's very bad because you know what? That's bad for the country. You know it's bad. But that's the way it works. But I give to everybody; they all love me. They don't love me so much anymore by the way, I have to tell you. But here's what happens. He'll call. I'd say he folds sometimes prior to 5 pm in the evening. But he could be tough and he may last 'till 12 pm the following day. And he'll say Please and five guys will call me that are friends of mine and, you know, who I couldn't care less. I'd say, No, you don't understand. I want that plant built in the United States. I want jobs in the United States. Now, this is just one of many deals. And here's what happens. I wold probably get a call the first day but maybe the second day because they're tough negotiators. And he'll say, Mr. President, would you reconsider? I'd say No. He'll say, Mr. President, we've decided to build the plant in Phoenix. Okay? It's so simple. It's so simple. We have totally incompetent people. Now, some people say they're bad people. I don't think they're that smart to be bad people. Honestly, I mean, a lot of people get angry when I say I don't think they're bad; I think they're stupid; I think they're incompetent. So we've got to take our country back. We've got to get rid of Obamacare. We've got to repeal it and replace it with something good. And we have to take care, and I know this doesn't sound very conservative, we've got to take care of everybody, not just the people up here. We've got to take care of everybody. Okay? Get used to it, conservatives. I love you, conservatives. Get used to it. Let's take care of everybody, please? And by the way, Obamacare doesn't. And if you look at the premiums, the premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles, frankly, you have to get hit with a Komatsu tractor in order to use them, they're so high. We can do it. You get rid of state lines. You put it out. You'll have great care for much less money. The country will spend much less, and we will take care of those people that can't do it. We have to, we have to, we have to! We have to build up our military. I'm in the real estate business, as many of you have heard. You'll see that in a couple of days, by the way. I'm in the real estate business and all the time I get listings of bases for sale, a naval, an army base, a marine. There are all these bases. I said How many bases are there? All the time I'm getting these listings for bases. I said, What are we doing? We are hated throughout the world. China is building in the South China Sea islands. We can't do that because we would not be able to get an environmental impact statement. Can you believe? We'd go through 25 years of being sued by the environmentalist. And by the way, I'd hate to say this. I've been given many, many environmental awards. I get a lot of environmental awards. But we have to take back the heart of our country. We have to do something special. We have to bring back, and let me tell you, in bringing back our military, in bringing back our military, we have to do something else. We have to take care of our veterans because our veterans are treated like their third class citizens and they are the greatest. Now, if you remember a few days ago, Bush was asked the simplest question Was Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? He couldn't give an answer. Took him five days before he said it was bad. Now, think of this. Think of this. Five days. How can you have a guy like that negotiating for you? Five days it took him and finally he said it was bad. Okay? He could have done it in the first three seconds. But it took him five days. And if you think about it, we spent $2 trillion, lost thousands of lives, thousands. We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place. All over. Amazing, I mean, amazing people. So we have wounded warriors all over. We got nothing. And today, Iraq is meeting with Iran to do some kind of merger. So in 2004, in Reuters, anyone from Reuters back there? I'm sure they are. There's an article in July of 2004: Trump said don't invade Iraq. Now, I am more for the military and I am the most militaristic person in this room. I would have a military that's so strong that we would never have to use it because people would say No way we're messing with them. No way we're messing with them. And I'd get along with Putin and I'd get along with China. You know, China, largest bank in the world is in China. They're my tenant. I just renewed their lease. Who speaks worse about China than me? No, I do it out of respect. But China, they just renewed their lease. We would never move to a build other than your building. They love it. But it's called respect. It's called respect. They respect smart things, smart people, smart deals. They have no respect for our country. So with Bush, if you people go with Bush, you're going to lose. I'll tell you one other thing and we're going to wrap it up now, but I'll tell you something. And this will be surprising to a lot of people. Thousands and thousands of people work for me. Tens of thousands. I've give tens of thousands, I've taken care of education, for families. I've taken care of health care at the highest level. I didn't even have to worry about Obamacare because my people do better. My people got lucky but I got lucky too, they're great people. But ISIS will be in such trouble. Oh. ISIS. ISIS, believe me, they will be in such trouble. You know the problem, have to say this. So we're fighting wars and we're backing all these stupid people that, honestly, I don't say they're stupid. They don't care. Like the Iraqis. They don't, they have no love for the country. The leadership, there is no leadership but let's assume there is, they're all thieves. They're all terrible people. 100% corrupt. So we send to one of our so called allies 2300 Humvees. Now, think of it. Normally, you'd send like three. How many are here? We send three. They're armor plated Humvees. You can imagine what they cost. They don't even report because it's probably so high that it's another scandal like the $500 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked and still doesn't work. So we send 2300 Humvees. One bullet is fired in the air, and the people we gave the Humvees to flee and the enemy takes them over. And they're better than the ones that our boys and women have. Because they were the best, they're gone in one day. Remember Yemen, how we had the victory? The big victory? It turned out to be a false victory because a few months later it was gone. If you think that those people, if you think that they want Yemen, take a look at a map with that long beautiful border along Saudi Arabia. They want the oil. Do you remember what I said, and I get a lot of credit for this. They said, He's the one guy, and I'm a very militaristic guy, but he's the one guy that said don't do Iraq because you'll destabilize it and then Iran will take over and then somebody else worse than than Saddam Hussein will take over the rest. ISIS, hey, Saddam Hussein was never as bad as these people. These people are brutal. They're chopping off everybody's heads, especially if you happen to be Christian. They chop off your head. They dunk people with a cage. Did you see that? They dunk them and drown them. These people make Saddam Hussein look like a choir boy. Okay? And I said this in 2004. Okay, now Bush goes in and he makes a mistake. And then Obama, frankly, we might as well have stayed there, but he made a mistake too. And I said, Keep the oil. Do you remember that? And everyone said, You can't keep the oil. This is a sovereign country. You can't keep the oil. I said, Keep the oil. We're in there now. You blew it. You shouldn't have gone in. And every other candidate is fleeing. They're all trying to say, Well, they didn't know. There was intelligence that said this. They all said Do it. I'm the only one that said no. I'm the only one that said No. Keep the oil, I said. I've been saying this for two, three years. Don't leave. Keep the oil. Because if you don't get it, Iran will get it or somebody else is going to get it. Iran is taking it and ISIS has it. And ISIS now is building a hotel in Iraq. They're competing with me. Can you believe it? They're renovating this building; they're building a hotel. They're wealthy. They have the oil. And I said, Keep it. And great criticism. Trump says keep the oil. Well, that's a sovereign country. Isn't it a horrible thing to say? These are stupid people we have leading us. So ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast, it would be, have to do it, have to do it. See, I think they overplayed their hand. I actually think they made a big mistake. When they started, like you take James Foley. So great. Such a great guy. I got to know his parents. I met the parents; they're very interesting They did the beheading and then they've done other, I said, You know, they're making a big mistake, ISIS, because if they wouldn't have done and if they wouldn't keep doing, we wouldn't have cared. We could have been gone. But you can't, not when you see what they're doing, you can't. Had they not done those things, the level of violence, we're like living in Medieval times. You know, when you hear of Medieval time, you always think we were all civilized. It's a jungle. It's horrible out there. But when they started doing the beheadings, they really, I think they made a mistake but not with Obama because he's weak and he's ineffective and he's not respected. Not respected. So here's the problem. Here's the kind of deals we make: James Foley is dead. Great guy. Amazing guy. Amazing parents. We have Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. So we negotiate for Sergeant Bergdahl, a no good traitor. Six people were killed trying to find him. Six young in this case men went out to try to get him; six of them never came back. Six people died and we have Sergeant Bergdahl. And here's our deal. This is just like the stupid deal that we're making with Iran on nuclear. This is just like everything else we do, the deals we make with China, the deals we make with Mexico. We don't know what we're doing. So we get Bergdahl, a no good traitor. Frankly, I'd renegotiate deals every once in a while. Not too often but I'd send him back, and if they don't want him, send him back anyways. I want to renegotiate that. They get five killers that are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including the people in this room. And these were the five people that they most wanted. So I call Obama the five for one President. Who would make that deal? Now, I don't think it's because he's a bad person. Who would make a deal like this? But these are the same deals that we make with all of these countries. When I look at Japan, I just go over from Los Angeles. We had a tremendous crowd there too. We had a tremendous crowd. And we had a big one in Las Vegas this morning. But when I look at these massive boats, I've never seen boats like this, the biggest boats with cars coming from Japan. And then we can't sell corn. We can't sell beef. It's peanuts. We can't sell beef. So we do about 20% to their 100%. So I said it in an idea on the way over. I said, Tell Japan that's okay. Everything's fine. We're going to cut your orders down to 20%. Let it match. Let it match. Simple deal. Simple deal. And I had another idea that's also very simple. When Mexico, and you remember when Fidel Castro took over, the opened his prisons and he sent everybody over to the United States and we accepted them and it was hell. We didn't send them back. We accepted them. In a much, much, much more sophisticated way, Mexico is doing that to us because why would they want to have a prisoner like these two horrible people that hurt so badly, destroyed, but hurt so badly the Shaw family and Kate's family. Why would they want to have them in jail for 40 years, paying for it? So I had an idea. The one with Kate came over five times. In my opinion, he was pushed out by Mexico. They don't want him. They don't want to take care of him. Why would they want to take care of him? And believe me, Univision, which I'm suing by the way for $500 million because they broke the contract, but Univision is doing the work of the Mexican government. And I don't blame them actually. I respect Mexico. I don't blame the Mexican government. I just wish our people were smart. Like they're really smart doing that. They're sending them to us and we're either putting them in jails or letting them go free, which is even worse. But we have to do something. So, I have an idea. I said every time an illegal comes to this country through the border because Mexico was pushing them over, remember that. And by the way, unbelievable people are coming. A lot of people that are illegal are great people. Just let's get it straight, they don't want to give it straight because the press are liars. They're terrible people. They're terrible people. Terrible. Not all of them but many of them. So here's an idea. So, Mexico is sending them. And by the way, they're coming from all over the world including the Middle East. Why not? Come on in. We're stupid. We'll take care of you. We'll pay. Get sick, we'll take care of your hospitalization. What kind of a plan do you want? So I had an idea. I think it's good. Every time Mexico really intelligently sends people over, we charge Mexico $100000 for every person they send over. Now, they make so much money that that's peanuts. It's not a lot. Could have made it much higher but I'm nice. I'm in a good mood today. We charge Mexico $100000 for every person. You'll see that it'll start to stop because that starts to add up. It starts to add up. We have to secure our borders. We have to do something to take back our country. I mean, don't kid yourself folks, what took place today, even by the dishonest press, what took place today is being seen all over the world. Look at all those cameras back there. This is being seen all over the world. People know. You know, it's a term I haven't heard for years but I was thinking about it. It's a term that I haven't heard for years but I really think it applies now more than maybe ever before and that's the term the silent majority. Have you all heard that? You don't hear it. When people start cutting up their credit cards at Macy's and won't go to Macy's anymore, when all of these things, and that's a big story but nobody wants to write it. That's fine. I don't care about me. But when you see the kind of power that the silent majority has and the silent majority is a problem. They want to go out. They want to lead a good life. They want to work hard. They want to have their family. They don't want to be involved in coming here and waiting on a line for hours and hours and coming in and listening to Trump. But the silent majority is back, and we're going to take the country back. And we are going to make America great again! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! I'm really honored to be with you. Thank you very much. It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you here today, exciting times for us in terms of the future of our country. We face extraordinary challenges but also some real opportunities, and that's what I wanted to talk about today. In fact, I wanted to announce a couple of policy initiatives today I haven't discussed before, so I actually put it in writing, and the good news is I finally was able to retrieve them from my email system. Anyway, thank you so much. I'm really honored to be here with you today, with all of you who are motivated to participate in the public square because of our values. And this is important, because we've always had this debate about, well, what role should faith play in your life, and what role should faith play in politics. That's a silly debate. For starters, our country was founded on a spiritual principle, on the idea that every human being has rights that are given to you by God, not, not by your government, not by the king. It was a revolutionary idea. And second, as a Christian, I am taught from the earliest days of my life that I'm supposed to model Jesus Christ, God made man, and that means I'm supposed to care for the less fortunate. That's supposed to mean that I'm supposed to try to be humble, that there's strength in weakness, that the meek shall inherit the earth, that my job is to care in love for my fellow man because there's never been a person who God didn't love. And so people better hope that my faith influences the way we govern, because these are important values. And unfortunately, they're eroding in our country. And I'm honored to be able to run for president. It's an extraordinary opportunity and one that I'm grateful for the blessing to be able to do. It's been over five months now since we started this campaign, and you know, at virtually every event that we do, I'll meet someone or I'll see something that reminds me of my parents, even here today, for my father worked a banquet bartender in rooms just like this, and he did that job well into his 70s. Many of you probably know this by now, but both my parents were born on the island of Cuba to poor families. And they were born into a society like most, if not almost every place outside of America, where their future largely depended on what their parents did. My mother was one of seven sisters who was born to a father who, because he was disabled by polio as a child, he struggled his whole life to find and keep jobs that allowed him to provide for his children. My father actually had it even tougher. His mother died when he was only nine. And the day after her funeral, at nine years of age, he had to go work in the streets of Havana with his father. He had to leave school. He would never go back to school, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life. After my parents were married in Cuba, they wanted something better for themselves and their own children. And so in 1956 they came to America, to the one place on earth where people like them could have a chance. And their early years in America were not easy either. But you know that in time they found good jobs. My father worked, as I said, as a bartender. And my mother had all kinds of jobs. She was a cashier. She was a maid. She was a stock clerk at KMart. They earned enough money to buy a home and raise a family and retire with security. And even though their jobs often required them to leave home before dawn and come back after bedtime, they were able to be there in the most important moments of their children's lives, to provide for our needs and to teach us the values that we needed to be successful. When I tell that story, I'm often reminded by people that I don't come from privilege. And the truth is if by privilege they mean wealth and power, that's true. I didn't inherit any money from my parents. But I nonetheless believe that I actually do come from extraordinary privilege, because I'm a citizen of the single greatest nation in all of human history, a nation founded on the fundamental belief that every person has a god given right to go as far as their talent and their work will take them; a nation who says to us that even the son of a bartender and a maid could have the same dreams and the same opportunities as someone who is born into wealth and into power. But I was also privileged because I was raised with something that's become increasingly rare. I was raised in a stable home by a mother and a father, a man and a woman who were married who loved each other, who loved their children, who were an active presence in our life, and who raised me and us to believe that if we lived with the right values and with the faith in an almighty God, there was nothing that we could not accomplish. Today that American dream that my family achieved is slipping out of reach for far too many. Our economy has fundamentally transformed since my parents' time. In fact, it's very different than the one I grew up in. Rapid advances in technology have replaced old jobs with new ones, and globalization has forced us into competition with dozens of other nations for jobs and innovation. And yet while our economy is transforming, our government policies are not. We have unfortunately a political class in this country that refuses to toss out its old and outdated ways of thinking when it comes to our economy, the way of thinking that says we need guardians in government to protect us from ourselves, that to help someone climb up the economic ladder, we have to pull someone else down, and that government, not the family, is the most important institution in society. Our outdated leaders fail to recognize the changes that it will take to seize the promise of this new economy. And as a result, that promise is passing us by. Today businesses are dying faster than they are forming. The cost of everyday life is soaring while wages remain the same. And too many parents feel as if the longer and harder they work, the further they and their children are falling behind. I want to be clear about something. Even with our many challenges, America is still the best equipped nation on the planet to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this new century. Ask yourself this: Is there any country on earth you would rather be? Is there any country you would trade places with? Or here's another way to think about it: When was the last time that you read about a boatload of American refugees arriving on the shores of another country? So America is still special. But recent years have proven that our exceptionalism is not self sustaining, that we didn't become special by accident, and we aren't going to stay that way without effort. We're not going to stay that way by looking to the same leaders and the same ideas that have led us to this point. I believe what the American people are looking for at this moment in our history is clear. They are looking for leaders who understand the changes that have occurred in our economy, who understand the unique challenges that are facing our families in this century, who will come here to this city and fight the status quo that is holding us back, and in its place offer clear alternatives for the future. Now, the political class sees this sentiment and they try to make sense of it all. But they can't, because never before, certainly in my lifetime, has the political class of our country, or the mainstream media that covers them, for that matter, been more out of touch with the American people than they are right now. Look at the deal with Iran, which is basically just a series of concessions to an enemy of the United States. The American people realize how bad the deal is. They oppose it by an overwhelming two to one margin. And yet Washington still can't and won't stop it. And the issues like this are numerous. They're so big. They're so consequential. These issues are so generational that people cannot help but ask, how can it be, how can it be that we sent a Republican majority to Congress and yet they're still not able to stop our country from sliding in the wrong direction? And we'll see how things progress. Just a few minutes ago Speaker Boehner announced that he will be resigning. And with all due respect to people that serve in government, it is important at this moment with respect to him and the service that he's provided to our country, it's not about him or anybody else and I'm not here today to bash anyone, but the time has come to turn the page. The time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country. And that extends to the White House and the presidency as well. And that's why, after just four and a half years in the Senate, I decided that I would run for president, because I realized that none of the problems I got elected to solve are going to be solved if we keep promoting the same people to higher and higher ranks within our government. Here's the simple truth: To set a new precedent in Washington, we need a new president in Washington. We need a president who understands that this economic transformation we've undergone is a perfect chance to embrace and reinvigorate the free enterprise economy, not to abandon it; a president who will fight Washington's special interests in both parties, not be coopted by them; who will take clear and even unpopular positions to confront the greatest threats to our nation. And most of all, what we need is a president who, on their first day in office, will put the left hand on the Bible and their right hand in the air and promise to uphold the entire Constitution, including the right of religious liberty, including the right to bear arms, and including the god given and inalienable right to life. Sadly, it's been almost eight years since we had a president like that. But if I have the opportunity to serve in the highest office in the land, I promise you that I will live by that creed and I will live by that pledge, because when I'm president I will empower our people rather than our government. And I will do that by recognizing that you cannot have a strong people without strong families. The truth is that what happens in our house, in your house, what happens in my house, is, more often than not, just as important for the future of our country, if not more so, than what happens in the White House. But too often, especially in recent years, Washington has tried to compete with the family rather than support it. In fact, it's tried to redefine family. It's persecuted and now even prosecuted those who do not agree with the new direction that those seek to take us. It has punished marriage, the foundation of family life, by taxing married couples more than singles. It has made it harder for parents to keep what they earn and it has challenged the values and supplanted the faith organizations that have provided the centuries of empowerment to our people. I have a plan to reform our government in a way that empowers families to thrive in the modern economy. And a major component of this will be reforms to family leave policy that I'd like to introduce for the first time here today. Now, I said a moment ago that one of the reasons why I'm so privileged is that I was born to two parents who were married and who were able to be a constant presence in our lives. This was an extraordinary and enormous advantage for me growing up. And that's why now, as a parent, I struggle with the demands of public life, the public life that I've chosen. It pains me every time that I have to miss a volleyball game or a football game or a field trip, even though I know that I'm doing this for them. And this struggle is not unique to me. It's a problem that almost every parent in America faces today. And the reason this hurts is because we know the greatest gift parents can give their children is the time we spend together, the values that only parents can teach, the love only parents can provide, the encouragement only parents can offer. And it cannot come via text or cellphone calls sometimes, at least not completely. It has to come through time spent together. And that's why one of the greatest threats to family today is that there are too many Americans who have to choose between being there for their children in times of great need or meeting the basic financial needs of their family. And like so many fundamental problems, this one can be traced back in part to the outdated policies from Washington, DC Our current law mandates that employees offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers with certain family or medical issues, like a newborn child in need of care, an elderly parent with declining health or a personal health crisis. But this has proven insufficient because taking unpaid leave is simply not a viable financial option for many American. Now, most of our current leaders, including Hillary Clinton, stick to this outdated way of thinking. They say that the only way to solve this problem is the way they think we can solve every problem: raise taxes, grow government, and place crippling requirements on private companies. I don't need to tell anyone here why that wouldn't work. It's the same reason Obamacare hasn't worked. Our policies should help workers, not cost them their jobs. And I believe we can fix this problem by creatively applying our free enterprise principles in a way that encourages businesses to choose to offer more family paid leave. To do this, we should provide a limited 25 percent, non refundable tax credit to any business that offers between four and 12 weeks of paid leave. For instance, if you're offered $1600 in paid leave for four weeks while you take care of your newborn child, which would be the equivalent of about $10 an hour, your employer could claim a tax credit of $400. This won't solve every scheduling conflict between work and family life. No policy can do that. But it will help ensure that our people don't have to sit behind a desk while the most profound moments of their lives pass them by. And it will help our businesses expand and create new jobs by allowing them to keep more of their money rather than send it to be wasted here in Washington. Conservatives, by the way, are already fighting hard on this issue. Senator Deb Fischer has been a leader on family leave reform and I'm glad to join her in her efforts as one way to address the problem. Now, unfortunately, our current president prefers not to sign legislation that's common sense. So these efforts will likely be something that we will need to take up if, God willing, I'm president. Doing so will be a step towards reclaiming the American dream in this century, but it will only be one step. Of course, people cannot be concerned about family leave if they don't have a good paying job to take leave from. So we need our next president to recognize an important fact that no one in Washington today seems to understand: Politicians don't create jobs. The American people create jobs. We need a president and we need leaders at every level of government who stop placing our people's faith in our government and start placing our government's faith in our people. So one way we'll know that I've done the right things as president, is that by the end of my term we won't be talking that much about Washington. We'll be too busy discussing the extraordinary achievements of everyday Americans. By the year 2020, this is what I hope we will be able to say: That we made our business tax code globally competitive, that we repealed and replaced Obamacare, that we placed a cap on regulations, and that we made our country the best place in the world to create jobs, and that as a result our people are creating thousands of businesses, millions of new high paying jobs, and their innovations are once again driving the progress of the world. In the year 2020, we want to be able to say that we reformed our higher education system, we made it more affordable and more accessible to every American. And as a result, our people are earning degrees that empower them to move from jobs that pay $10 an hour to jobs that pay $70000 a year, that millions are beginning to emerge from the shadow of student loan debt, and that high schoolers are graduating with certifications to immediately enter good paying careers. In the year 2020, I want to be able to say that we've secured our borders first, that we've reformed our legal immigration system so that people come to this country based on what they can contribute to our economy, on the basis of whether they want to become an American, not simply live in America, not whether they have a family member living here. And that we've done what we needed to do to save Social Security and Medicare without having to make any changes for people currently on it. And that as a result of these changes, our people are growing our economy at a historic rate, our deficits are finally beginning to dwindle, and the national debt is being brought under control so that it no longer is threatening to take away everything that makes our country so special. In the year 2020, I want to be able to say that we have defended religious liberty. That we have supported, that we have worked hard to support the right of our people not just to hold traditional views, but to exercise them, to express them. That we've reformed the tax code to encourage marriage rather than punishing it. And that we made it easier for parents to afford the cost of raising their children, and that as a result our families have found financial security, that they're raising strong children with strong values, and that they're instilling in their kids all the hope in the future of America that our parents instilled in us. That's what I want to be able to talk about in 2020, the accomplishments of our people, not of Washington. But there's one more important point that needs to be made, one that transcends policy and politics altogether. No candidate for president can claim to stand on the side of our people if they do not believe that every person has a right to exist. And that's why the issue of right to live is more than political or policy related. It is not a political issue, it is a human rights issue. It is a definitional issue about what kind of country we want to be. In a world where life is increasingly not valued, where people are summarily discarded, America must stand for the belief that all life is worthy of protection, because all life comes from God. And so by the year 2020, I hope we will be able to say that abortions after 20 weeks are illegal, that no taxpayer money is used to fund abortions here or abroad, and that Planned Parenthood doesn't receive a penny from the federal government. So let me just close, my time is up, and so let me just close by saying this: For many of us, for me, for most of you who that were born and raised in this country, it's sometimes easy to forget how special America is, because this is all we've ever known. But I had one more blessing. I was raised by people who knew how special America was because they knew what it was like to lose a country, because they knew what life was like outside this country, because they understood how different America was from the rest of the world. My parents, my grandfather, they taught me by word and by deed that what makes America great is not that we have more rich people than anybody else, every country has rich people. What makes America great is that the dreams that are impossible everywhere else are possible here. And why is that? Well, it's because of the choices that the people before us made. Almost every other country in the world chose to have a government run their economy. In those countries, people who can influence the government, they're the ones that keep winning, and everybody else stays the same. The employee never becomes the employer. The small business can never compete with a big business. And no matter how hard your parents work or how many sacrifices they made, if you weren't born into the right family in those countries, there is only so far you can go. But the Americans before us chose something very different. They chose individual liberty. They chose limited government that exists to protect our rights, not to decide them or to grant them. And yet there are still people in American politics, sadly in both parties, who cling to the belief that America is better off adopting the economic policies of the countries that people come here to get away from. Now, look, this is a free society. People have a right to believe whatever they want. But I don't have that option. You see, I'm just a generation removed from a very different life. My parents came here with virtually nothing, no knowledge of English at the time, no money, no friends. The only thing they had was the strong determination to provide their children all the opportunities they themselves never had. And in America they were never rich or wealthy or influential, but their hard work opened doors for their children that had closed for them. Everything that I've accomplished, everything I will ever accomplish, I owe to God, to my parents' sacrifices, and to the United States of America. For me, my parents' story is the essence of the American Dream. It's a story that's rare in the world, but so common here. Because the truth is, it's all our stories. Here in this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. And so now it is our turn. This election is a generational choice about what kind of country, what kind of America we are going to leave for our children, and what kind of country we will be in the 21st century. The final verdict on our generation is going to be written by Americans who have not yet been born. Let us make sure that they write that we made the right choice, that in the early years of this century, faced with troubling and uncertain times, there were those who believed that the great American story had run its course, but we did not agree. Fear did not lead us to abandon our liberty. We fought for and held onto those things that made us exceptional. And because we did, there was still one place on Earth where the individual was more important than the state. There was still one place on Earth where where you come from does not determine how far you get to go. Because we made the right choice, because we did, we didn't just restore the American Dream, we expanded it and extended it to reach more families and more people than ever before. And because we did, for at least one generation more the American miracle lived on. After months of deliberation and prayer about the future of our country, I have come here tonight to make an announcement on how I believe I can best serve her. I chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation's identity as the land of opportunity. And I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century. In this very room five decades ago, tens of thousands of Cuban exiles began their new lives in America. Their story is part of the larger story of the American miracle. How, united by a common faith in their God given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them, a collection of immigrants and exiles, former slaves and refugees, became one people, and together built the freest and most prosperous nation ever. For almost all of human history, power and wealth belonged only to a select few. Most people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this. Both of my parents were born to poor families in Cuba. After his mother died when he was nine, my father left school to go work. My mother was one of seven girls raised by a disabled father who struggled to provide for his family. When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves. But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past. So in 1956 they came here, to the one place on earth where the aspirations of people like them could be more than just dreams. My father became a bartender. My mother a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. They never made it big. But they were successful. Two immigrants with little money or education found stable jobs, owned a home, retired with security and gave all four of their children a life far better than their own. My parents achieved what came to be known as the American Dream. But now, too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible: Hard working families living paycheck to paycheck, one unexpected expense away from disaster Young Americans, unable to start a career, a business or a family, because they owe thousands in student loans for degrees that did not lead to jobs And small business owners, left to struggle under the weight of more taxes, more regulations and more government. Why is this happening in a country that for over two centuries has been defined by equality of opportunity? Because while our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the twentieth century. They are busy looking backward, so they do not see how jobs and prosperity today depend on our ability to compete in a global economy. So our leaders put us at a disadvantage by taxing, borrowing and regulating like it's 1999. They look for solutions in yesterday, so they don't see that good paying modern jobs require different skills and more education than the past. They blindly support an outdated higher education system that is too expensive and inaccessible to those who need it most. And they have forgotten that when America fails to lead, global chaos inevitably follows, so they appease our enemies, betray our allies and weaken our military. At the turn of the 19th century, a generation of Americans harnessed the power of the Industrial Age and transformed this country into the leading economy in the world. And the 20th century became the American Century. Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century. If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace Obamacare, the American people will create millions of better paying modern jobs. If we create a 21st century system of higher education that provides working Americans the chance to acquire the skills they need, that no longer graduates students with mountains of debt and degrees that do not lead to jobs, and that graduates more students from high school ready to work, then our people will be prepared to seize their opportunities in the new economy. If we remember that family, not government, is the most important institution in society, that all life deserves protection, and that all parents deserve to choose the education that's right for their children, then we will have a strong people and a strong nation. And if America accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this administration's dangerous concessions to Iran, and its hostility to Israel; by reversing the hollowing out of our military; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources, care and gratitude they deserve; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world; then our nation will be safer, the world more stable, and our people more prosperous. This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be. Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. But yesterday is over, and we are never going back. We Americans are proud of our history, but our country has always been about the future. Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. We can't do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them. That is why today, grounded by the lessons of our history, and inspired by the promise of our future, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America. My candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad. In many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege. I recognize the challenges of this campaign, and the demands of the office I seek. But in this endeavor as in all things, I find comfort in the ancient command to, Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go. I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as President. I am humbled by the realization that America doesn't owe me anything; but I have a debt to America I must try to repay. This isn't just the country where I was born; America is the place that changed my family's history. I regret my father did not live to see this day in person. He used to tell me all the time: En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos. In this country, you will achieve all the things we never could. On days when I am tired or discouraged, I remember the sound of his keys jingling at the front door of our home, often well past midnight, as he returned from another long day at work. When I was younger, I didn't fully appreciate all he did for us, but now as my own children grow older, I fully understand. My father was grateful for the work he had, but that was not the life he wanted for his children. He wanted all the dreams he once had for himself to come true for us. He wanted all the doors that closed for him to be open for me. My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room. That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream. Whether or not we remain a special country will depend on whether that journey is still possible for those trying to make it now: The single mother who works long hours for little pay so her children don't have to struggle the way she has The student who takes two buses before dawn to attend a better school halfway across town The workers in our hotel kitchens, the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods, the late night janitorial staff that clean our offices and the bartenders who tonight are standing in the back of a room somewhere If their American Dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country. But if they succeed, the 21st Century will be another American Century. This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency. To succeed on this journey, I will need your prayers, your support, and ultimately, your vote. Tonight I am asking you to take that first step with me, by joining us. My wife Jeanette and my four children are here tonight. The next 19 months will take me far from home. I will miss watching Amanda run track, Daniella play volleyball, Anthony play football and Dominick play soccer. But I have chosen this course because this election is about them. Theirs is the most important generation in American history. If we can capture the promise of this new century they will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever. But if we fail, they will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one left for their parents. The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice. That in the early years of this century, faced with a rapidly changing and uncertain world, our generation rose to face the great challenges of our time. And because we did, there was still one place in the world where who you come from does not determine how far you can go. Because we did, the American miracle lived on. And because we did, our children and theirs lived in a new American Century. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much. I always feel welcome at Miami Dade College. This is a place that welcomes everyone with their hearts set on the future, a place where hope leads to achievement, and striving leads to success. For all of us, it is just the place to be in the campaign that begins today. We are 17 months from the time for choosing. The stakes for America's future are about as great as they come. Our prosperity and our security are in the balance. So is opportunity, in this nation where every life matters and everyone has the right to rise. Already, the choice is taking shape. The party now in the White House is planning a no suspense primary, for a no change election. To hold onto power. To slog on with the same agenda under another name: That's our opponents' call to action this time around. That's all they've got left. And you and I know that America deserves better. They have offered a progressive agenda that includes everything but progress. They are responsible for the slowest economic recovery ever, the biggest debt increases ever, a massive tax increase on the middle class, the relentless buildup of the regulatory state, and the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making. I, for one, am not eager to see what another four years would look like under that kind of leadership. The presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next. So, here's what it comes down to. Our country is on a very bad course. And the question is: What are we going to do about it? The question for me is: What am I going to do about it? And I have decided. I am a candidate for president of the United States. We will take command of our future once again in this country. We will lift our sights again, make opportunity common again, get events in the world moving our way again. We will take Washington, the static capital of this dynamic country, out of the business of causing problems. We will get back on the side of free enterprise and free people. I know we can fix this. Because I've done it. Here, in this great and diverse state that looks so much like America. So many challenges could be overcome if we just get this economy growing at full strength. There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of four percent a year. And that will be my goal as president, four percent growth, and the 19 million new jobs that come with it Economic growth that makes a difference for hard working men and women, who don't need reminding that the economy is more than the stock market. Growth that lifts up the middle class, all the families who haven't gotten a raise in 15 years. Growth that makes a difference for everyone. It's possible. It can be done. We made Florida number one in job creation and number one in small business creation. 1 million new jobs, 4 percent growth, higher family income, eight balanced budgets, and tax cuts eight years in a row that saved our people and businesses 19 billion dollars. All this plus a bond upgrade to Triple A compared to the sorry downgrade of America's credit in these years. That was the commitment, and that is the record that turned this state around. I also used my veto power to protect our taxpayers from needless spending. And if I am elected president, I'll show Congress how that's done. Leaders have to think big, and we've got a tax code filled with small time thinking and self interested politics. What swarms of lobbyists have done, we can undo with a vastly simpler system, clearing out special favors for the few reducing rates for all. What the IRS, EPA, and entire bureaucracy have done with overregulation, we can undo by act of Congress and order of the president. Federal regulation has gone far past the consent of the governed. It is time to start making rules for the rule makers. When we get serious about limited government, we can pursue the great and worthy goals that America has gone too long without. We can build our future on solvency instead of borrowed money. We can honor our commitments on the strength of fiscal integrity. With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation, and with presidential leadership, we can make it happen within five years. If we do all of this, if we do it relentlessly, and if we do it right, we will make the United States of America an economic superpower like no other. We will also challenge the culture that has made lobbying the premier growth industry in the nation's capital. The rest of the country struggles under big government, while comfortable, complacent interest groups in Washington have been thriving on it. A self serving attitude can take hold in any capital, just as it once did in Tallahassee. I was a governor who refused to accept that as the normal or right way of conducting the people's business. I will not accept it as the standard in Washington. We don't need another president who merely holds the top spot among the pampered elites of Washington. We need a president willing to challenge and disrupt the whole culture in our nation's capital. I will be that president because I was a reforming governor, not just another member of the club. There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd or filing an amendment and calling that success. As our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that. We are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it. In government, if we get a few big things right, we can make life better for millions of people, especially for kids in public schools. Think of what we all watched not long ago in Baltimore where so many young adults are walking around with no vision of a life beyond the life they know. It's a tragedy played out over and over and over again. After we reformed education in Florida, low income student achievement improved here more than in any other state. We stopped processing kids along as if we didn't care, because we do care, and you don't show that by counting out anyone's child. You give them all a chance. Here's what I believe. When a school is just another dead end, every parent should have the right to send their child to a better school, public, private, or charter. Every school should have high standards, and the federal government should have nothing to do with setting them. Nationwide, if I am president, we will take the power of choice away from the unions and bureaucrats and give it back to parents. We made sure of something else in Florida, that children with developmental challenges got schooling and caring attention, just like every other girl and boy. We didn't leave them last in line. We put them first in line because they are not a problem. They are a priority. That is always our first and best instinct in this nation filled with charitable hearts. Yet these have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience. And the leading Democratic candidate recently hinted of more trouble to come. Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary those beliefs, quote, have to be changed. That's what she said, and I guess we should at least thank her for the warning. The most galling example is the shabby treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Christian charity that dared to voice objections of conscience to Obamacare. The next president needs to make it clear that great charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor need no federal instruction in doing the right thing. It comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother, and I'm going with the Sisters. It's still a mystery to me why, in these violent times, the president a few months ago thought it relevant at a prayer breakfast to bring up the Crusades. Americans don't need lectures on the Middle Ages when we are dealing abroad with modern horrors committed by fanatics. From the beginning, our president and his foreign policy team have been so eager to be the history makers that they have failed to be the peacemakers. With their phone it in foreign policy, the Obama Clinton Kerry team is leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unraveling. This supposedly risk averse administration is also running us straight in the direction of the greatest risk of all, military inferiority. It will go on automatically until a president steps in to rebuild our armed forces and take care of our troops and our veterans. They have my word, I will do it. We keep dependable friends in this world by being dependable ourselves. I will rebuild our vital friendships. That starts by standing with the brave, democratic State of Israel. American led alliances need rebuilding too, and better judgment is called for in relations far and near. Ninety miles to our south, there is talk of a state visit by our outgoing president. But we don't need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba. We need an American president to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people, and I am ready to be that president. Great things like that can really happen. And in this country of ours, the most improbable things can happen. Take that from a guy who met his first president on the day he was born, and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital. The person who handled both introductions is here today. She's watching what I say, and frankly, with all these reporters around, I'm watching what she says. Please say hello to my wonderful Mom, Barbara Bush. Long before the world knew my parents' names, I knew I was blessed to be their son. And they didn't mind at all that I found my own path. It led from Texas to Miami by way of Mexico. In 1971, 8 years before then candidate Ronald Reagan said that we should stop thinking of our neighbors as foreigners, I was ahead of my time in cross border outreach. Across a plaza, I saw a girl. She spoke only a little English. My Spanish was okay but not that great. With some intensive study, we got that barrier out of the way in a hurry. In the short version, it has been a gracious walk through the years with the former Columba Garnica de Gallo. Whatever else I might or might not have going for me, I've got the quiet joy of a man who can say that the most wonderful friend he has in the world is his own wife. And together, we had the not so quiet joy of raising three children who have brought us nothing but happiness and pride: George, Noelle, and Jeb. The boys have also brought us more Bushes, their wives, Mandi and Sandra, and our grandchildren Georgia, Prescott, Vivian, and Jack. Campaigns aren't easy, and they're not supposed to be. And I know that there are good people running for president. Quite a few, in fact. And not a one of us deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family, or family narrative. It's nobody's turn. It's everybody's test, and it's wide open, exactly as a contest for president should be. The outcome is entirely up to you, the voters. It is entirely up to me to earn the nomination of my party and then to take our case all across this great and diverse nation. As a candidate, I intend to let everyone hear my message, including the many who can express their love of country in a different language: Ayúdenos en tener una campaña que les da la bienvenida. Trabajen con nosotros por los valores que compartimos y para un gran futuro que es nuestro para construir para nosotros y nuestros hijos. Júntense a nuestra causa de oportunidad para todos, a la causa de todos que aman la libertad y a la causa noble de los Estados Unidos de América. In any language, my message will be an optimistic one because I am certain that we can make the decades just ahead the greatest time ever to be alive in this world. That chance, that hope requires the best that is in us, and I will give it my all. I will campaign as I would serve, going everywhere, speaking to everyone, keeping my word, facing the issues without flinching, and staying true to what I believe. I will take nothing and no one for granted. I will run with heart. I will run to win. It begins here and now. And I'm asking for your vote. Thank you. God Bless You. Thank you very much. It's good to be with all of you, and I appreciate the kind hospitality of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. I bring greetings from the wonderful guy who is still very proud to have been Ronald Reagan's vice president. A competition turned into friendship, and the better my Dad got to know Ronald Reagan, the more he admired and loved him. On my way here this afternoon, I made a call to Nancy Reagan, to thank her for this honor and let her know how much we all love her. Seven elections have come and gone since the Reagan name was last on the ballot. Yet in many ways, that name, and the qualities it brings to mind, is still the standard. A leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words, it was President Reagan who took command of events, rebuilt America's strength, and moved the world toward peace. Strategically and morally, he conceded nothing to America's enemies. He believed that the Cold War could be won, not just endlessly managed, and in the end he put an age of conflict behind us. They don't always give out peace prizes for that, but peace is what Ronald Reagan left behind, and that is the legacy of a good and great man. In our time as well, it is strength, and will, and clarity of purpose that make all the difference. Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes. We've seen in recent years how critical each one of these principles is to our security, because when it counted most, they were missing. To really grasp what the next president will face, we have to look candidly at a few policies that have gone very wrong in these years above all, in what we used to call the global war on terror. Despite elaborate efforts by the administration to avoid even calling it by name, one of the very gravest threats we face today comes from radical Islamic terrorists. The terrorists are possessed by the same violent ideology that gave us 9/11, and they are on the offensive and gaining ground. It is not true, and was wishful thinking by the Administration to claim, that the tide of war is receding. The reality is that radical Islam has been spreading like a pandemic, across the Middle East, throughout Africa and to parts of Asia, even in the nations of the West, finding recruits in Europe and the United States. Here's another stark reality: Seven years ago, the long awaited jihadist caliphate existed only in the fevered imagination of the terrorists. Today, the radicals' caliphate exists as an actual place, occupying a stretch of land larger than Indiana. ISIS, a genocidal terrorist army, controls large parts of two countries, and is gaining influence in others. And yet well into this nightmare, President Obama's administration, by its own admission, has no strategy to stop it. In place of one, they are pursuing a minimalist approach of incremental escalation. The results have been a creeping US involvement, without any strategic results, the worst of both worlds. A year of limited strikes and other half measures has made little discernible difference in the sum total of the ISIS danger. A halting, ineffective effort against them has only emboldened these terrorists, leaving the pandemic unchecked. Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, and other cities that American and allied troops died to liberate, are now under the black flag of ISIS. Inside the caliphate, non believers are forced to convert, and those who do not, can expect a horrible fate. A special hatred is reserved for Christians and other religious minorities. In the Middle East today, we are witnessing a mass persecution and exodus of the followers of Jesus Christ. Nor is any allowance made for adherents of Islam found lacking in zeal by ISIS, which has filled mass graves with innocent Muslims. Potential recruits of ISIS, ready for their own taste of violence, can even follow it all on social media. It's a time when mass murderers have Twitter handles, Facebook and Instagram pages, using these to add a veneer of glamor to their exploits. We need to work with the owners of the relevant companies, and give careful thought to how we address this problem. Among followers worldwide, ISIS is hailed as the strong horse, the glorious cleanser and restorer of Islam, and that word is getting out on Western based social media. This helps explain the spread of ISIS and the terrorist pandemic in the Middle East and beyond, including thousands recruited from Europe, and more than a hundred from America, giving us ISIS terrorists with Western passports. The Islamic State and its followers are an asymmetric threat needing just one big strike to inflict devastation. What we are facing in ISIS and its ideology is, to borrow a phrase, the focus of evil in the modern world. And civilized nations everywhere, especially those with power, have a duty to oppose and defeat this enemy. No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially. Yet in a long experience that includes failures of intelligence and military setbacks, one moment stands out in memory as the turning point we had all been waiting for. And that was the surge of military and diplomatic operations that turned events toward victory. It was a success, brilliant, heroic, and costly. And this nation will never forget the courage and sacrifice that made it all possible. So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary? That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill, and that Iran has exploited to the full as well. ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time. Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton, the storied team of rivals, took office? So eager to be the history makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else's problem. Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous. All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone. Another terrible miscalculation, unfolding right now, is a different story. That would be the Obama Clinton Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force in the region when in fact they are deceitful dictators causing nothing but instability. Whenever bad things happen in the Middle East, from Israel's borders to the shores of Yemen, the influence of the mullahs is rarely far from the scene. Here is a regime that supports terrorism, threatens to destroy Israel, has for years been trying to develop nuclear weapons, routinely commits human rights violations, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq, and even now is unlawfully detaining American citizens. Iran, its ally Assad, its terrorist proxy Hizballah, and the sectarian militias it sponsors have fueled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, that have helped give rise to ISIS. Yet the president's deal with Iran confronts none of these problems. And least of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. In fact the deal prepares the way for that capability. With the lifting of sanctions, the deal also frees up more than 100 billion dollars for Iran's security services to use as they wish. In effect, the primary investors in a violent, radical Middle East have just received a new round of funding, courtesy of the United States and the United Nations. And, this is President Obama's idea of a diplomatic triumph. It is a deal unwise in the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme. It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America. If the Congress does not reject this deal, then the damage must be undone by the next president, and it will be my intention to begin that process immediately. Knowing what has gone wrong, however, is not the same as knowing how to set it right. The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity, and confidence that only American leadership can provide. Radical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming, and I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected President of the United States. We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace. Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail. In all of this, the United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region. Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the most populous Arab country and the wealthiest, are important partners of the United States. Those relationships have been badly mishandled by this administration. Both countries are key to a better coordinated regional effort against terrorism. We need to restore trust, and work more closely with them against common threats. We have very capable partners, likewise, in the United Arab Emirates, who are willing and able to take the fight to the extremists. We have a moderate and quite formidable leader in King Abdullah of Jordan. We have an ally in the new democratic government in Tunisia, and a fragile democracy in Lebanon, nations that are both under assault by radicals and terrorists. Across the region, responsible governments need no persuading of what the moment requires. It requires action, coordination, and American leadership to bring it all together. My strategy meets the unique circumstances in each of the two countries, Iraq and Syria, in which ISIS now has territory. And let's start with Iraq, and the five broad actions I would take as president to help remove the threat from that country. First, we must support the Iraqi forces, which right now have the will to win, but not the means. As matters stand, the United States has been helping to reconstitute Iraqi security services and to aid the Kurdish peshmerga. We need to broaden and expedite our efforts to help ensure Iraqis rebuild their security sector, not only to win against ISIS, but to break free of Iranian influence. And that effort should also involve even greater engagement with the Sunni tribes, whose fighting units served side by side with Americans to defeat Al-Qaeda in Iraq and were then disbanded by the Maliki government. Second, we must give these forces the consistent advantage of American air power, to cover their operations and to strike with fierce precision. The strategy has to include forward air controllers, whose skill and accuracy would severely hinder the enemy's freedom of movement. This would greatly improve the ability of fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to provide necessary close air support to local ground forces. ISIS fighters try blending into the civilian landscape. Our spotters on the ground will enable us to hit them hard, and rarely miss. Third, we must make better use of the limited forces we have by giving them a greater range of action. Right now, we have around 3500 soldiers and marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed. We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces. But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country. Our unrivaled warfighters know that it is simply not enough to dispense advice and training to local forces, then send them on their way and hope for the best. Canadian troops are already embedded in Iraqi units to very good effect. Our soldiers and marines need the go ahead to do that as well, to help our partners outthink and outmaneuver the enemy. Fourth, we should provide more support to the Kurds, giving them decisive military power against ISIS. In Iraq's Kurdish region, we have loyal friends and brave and skilled fighters. If I am commander in chief, the United States will make certain that the Kurds have everything they need to win. And finally, our strategy in Iraq has to restart the serious diplomatic efforts that can help that country move in the right direction. Only Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can decide if they will live together and share power and resources in a way that will serve their interests, assuring the survival of their country. But these partners have to know that while the United States is there in measure, we are also there in earnest and for the long haul. They will come through for their country, but they've got to be certain that we have their back. Now, the situation in Syria is quite different from the one in Iraq. In some ways, it is even more complex because we have no large, cohesive force to work with. And here, too, we have seen what ruin and suffering can follow when America doesn't lead. Of 23 million Syrians, about 11 million have been displaced or fled the country altogether. More than two hundred thousand people have so far been killed in the mayhem. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad is deploying every ruthless means to stay in power. Long brutalized by that regime, now under assault from ISIS, Syrian moderates want to fight against both enemies, and they view the regime as the greater evil. It's a sorrowful picture when you think back on how it could have been avoided. Exactly four years ago, we heard words that still hang in the air of the Middle East, when President Obama declared that the time has come for President Assad to step aside. Then, three years ago, came another pronouncement, that any use of chemical weapons by Assad would be a red line, inviting tough consequences for the regime. If the choice was between silence and these idle, grandiose words, it would have been better to say nothing at all. What followed is that Assad used those weapons, again and again, and there were no serious consequences whatsoever. Having lost our credibility on such an epic scale, it is hard to get it back. But we had better try, because the longer we do nothing, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and the more directly our friends and our interests are threatened. Our ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long term political stability in that country. Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its planless aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Syria will need a stable government, and a transition free of more sectarian bloodletting will depend on the credible moderate forces we help unite and build up today. To that end, my strategy would bring American influence to bear in four all important areas of action. First, a coordinated, international effort is essential to give Syria's moderate forces the upper hand. As it is, the Qataris, the Turks, the Saudis, and others have been supporting fighting groups in Syria. But these groups are not always working to common purpose. And if there's anything that moderate forces in Syria cannot afford right now, it's confusion and disunity. Under my strategy, the aim would be to draw the moderates together and back them up, as one force. And we should back that force up all the way through, not just in taking the fight to the enemy, but in helping them to form a stable, moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone. It's a tough, complicated diplomatic and military proposition, even more so than the current situation in Iraq. But it can be done. We saw in the Iraq surge how Islamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces. And the strategic elements in both cases are the same, we have to support local forces, and we must stay true to our word. Second, we have to expand and vastly improve the recruitment and training of Syrian forces fighting ISIS. At the moment, too many in Syria doubt that they can count on us, which explains why our recruiting and training have basically come to nothing. When a five hundred million dollar program gets you 54 recruits, you know the plan's not working out. The reality is, our recruitment efforts have been failing in Syria because we are not respected anymore as a reliable actor in the region. And we have to change that impression with the kind of clear, consistent, and credible action that every nation should expect from the United States of America. Third, we must over time establish multiple safe zones in Syria. It's a measure of progress that we have joined with the Turks to create a small, ISIS free zone in the northern part of the country. But we need to go beyond well this, by establishing safe zones to protect Syrians not only from ISIS, but also from Assad. Fourth, we and our partners should declare a no fly zone in Syria, and then work to expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime. Enforce that no fly zone, and we'll stop the regime's bombing raids that kill helpless civilians. It could also keep Iranian flights from resupplying the regime, Hizballah, and other bad actors. A no fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it. When we talk about no fly zones in Syria, precision airstrikes in Iraq, or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats, all of this assumes that such power is there when we need it. Yet here as well, the shortsightedness of the present administration will leave a cost. We are in the seventh year of a significant dismantling of our own military, in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying. And I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America. A winning strategy against the Islamic State, or against any threat to ourselves and our friends, depends ultimately on the military strength that underwrites American influence. Let that slip away, and what would America be in world affairs, except one more well intentioned voice at the United Nations? In any effort of ours to overcome violence and secure peace, a winning strategy depends on maintaining unequaled strength, and we can never take it for granted. I might add that this includes strength among our intelligence services, military and civilian. No men and women receive so little credit for doing so much to track dangers and keep us safe. These skilled and brave Americans can be sure of this: If I become commander in chief, they will receive the tools they need and the gratitude, respect, and support they deserve. A good many people who serve in our military and intelligence agencies are at mid career. And I venture to guess that for quite a few of them, their calling has something to do with their coming of age in the Reagan years. Yet any nostalgia for that time has to recall, not only a falling wall and collapsing evil empire, but also the fear, and tension, and dead serious challenges that could all have played out so very differently. From the distance of decades, even the greatest successes in security and foreign policy can look almost inevitable. Of course, nothing had to happen as it did. Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it. But then along came, one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most. It's that way for us too, in having to deal with long conflicts and serious threats that are again on the offensive. And in living up to our responsibilities, we can always use a little more of the Reagan spirit. rejecting with contempt the idea that conflict must be endless, or that the spread of danger and violence is inevitable. It is not. For generations, American led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace. This is the way forward in our time as well, led by a president who is resolute, as I will be, in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears. We can protect our people, put adversaries back in retreat, get things moving our way again, and win back the momentum for freedom's cause. In all of this, let us never forget that in fighting evil, we are doing good, in stopping the merciless, we are delivering justice, and in destroying the violent, we are defending the innocent. This is the work that America is in this world to do. Let us meet that duty with confidence, faith, and resolve. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you New Jersey. Thank you. And thank you to Livingston. You know lots of people have asked me over the course of last week, why here? Why here? Because everything started here for me. Everything started here for me. The confidence. The education. The friends. The family. And the love that I've always felt for and from this community. When I decided to make this announcement, there wasn't any choice. I had to come home and Livingston is home for me. And I want to thank Sheila Goldclang, a dear friend of mine and my mom's and a wonderful representative of this town for welcoming us here today. And I want to thank my friend Lynn Groney. Now, listen, this is very much you some of you might be confused. You know, it may be that you thought she was being booed by her high school classmates. She was not. For reasons that I will not explain, Lynn's nickname in high school was the juice. Hence, it's not a boo, it's the juice. And Lynn, thank you for being here. I'm also here, because this is where my family raised me. You'll hear a lot, and have heard a lot from me about my mother and father. All of us know that for good and for bad, where we come from is our parents. And so you heard both Sheila and Lynn today. I'm here in Livingston because all those years ago, my mother and father became the first of either of their families to leave the city of Newark to come here and make this home for us. My mom isn't with us today, but I feel here. And my dad is with us today and I'm really really privileged to have him. They raised my brother and I and brought us here to Livingston when we were four years old and two years old. And then our sister Dawn joined us a few years later. And this is where we grew up. These were the fields we played on. These are the playgrounds we played on. This is the school we built our friends with and learned with. And up until I left to share a room with Mary Pat, I shared a room with Todd the entire time. It was a smooth transition. And my sister Dawn and Todd are as big a part of today as anybody else and they're both here today and I thank them. Everyone thinks I'm the politician in the family. We did a coin flip when we got married. I called tails. Tails never fails so I'm the guy who ran. But the politician just as good as me in the family is the woman that I met all those years ago at the University of Delaware. From a family of ten people. People say why aren't you shy in a crowd, I say you should see the family I married into. My wife has been an indispensable part of everything that I've done with my life over the last thirty years and she is largely responsible for the four amazing people that you see standing with her. And ever since I've been governor, I've been happy to use the veto at home too. And so far so good I have not been overridden there either. So I'm glad they're here today and for Andrew and Sarah and Patrick and Bridget, I couldn't be prouder of four children than I am of them. I told you that my parents moved to Livingston and they moved to Livingston to make this part of their fulfillment of their dream. Of their version of the American dream. They both lost their fathers at a young age and were raised by extraordinarily strong women under really difficult circumstances. My dad, one of the best students of his high school class, admitted to Columbia University. Because his father passed away, he couldn't go. He didn't have the money. He went to work and got drafted into the army and came home. And went to work at the Breyer's Ice cream plant in Newark, NJ. And then decided after he met my mom that it was time for him to make more with his life and he went to school at night at Rutgers for six years while working at those jobs during the day so he could get his degree in accounting and my mother, one of the proudest pictures she ever had was the one she called one of our first family pictures. It was my mom and dad on the day that my dad graduated Rutgers in June of 1962. It was the first person in either one of their families to get a college degree and it was the first family picture because she was 6 months pregnant with me. And the smiles on both of their faces that day were indicative of not what they had accomplished, but what they saw coming ahead of them. Their smiles were about the fact that they thought that nothing was out of reach for them now. They had each other, they were building a family, they worked together, and then with the help of both of those strong women the, they gave them five thousand dollars each, probably all the money they had in the world, to put a down payment on a house in this town to give their children a chance to take the dream they had started to build and to make it even bigger and even better. So I not only think about my mom and dad today, I think about my two grandmothers. Women who raised children largely on their own. Women who knew how to work and who knew that hard work would deliver something for their children. And I know that both of them are watching down today and that part of today is a fulfillment of their dream too. And I'm thinking about both of them. One of the things my mother used to say all the time was Christopher if you work hard enough, you can be anything. She said God's given you so many gifts, if you just work hard enough, you can be anything. And that story is proof. It's proof. Parents who came from nearly nothing, except for that hard work. Parents who brought little to their marriage except for their love for each other and that hard work. And that hard work not only produced a great life for me and my brother and my sister, but think about how amazing this country is that one generation removed from the guy who was working on the floor of the plant of the Breyer's Ice Cream plant, his son is the two term governor of the state where he was born and raised. See, that's not only what my parents have done for me but what that's what New Jersey has done for us. See this place, this place that represents the most ethnically diverse state in the country. The most densely populated state in the country. We're all different and we're on top of each other like you're on top of each other in this gym. And what has come from that, what has come from that is the absolute belief that not only can all of us achieve whatever dream we want to achieve, because of the place where we live and the opportunities that it gives us, but not only can we do it together, but we have to do it together. We have no choice but to work together, this country needs to work together again, not against each other. When I became governor six years ago, we had a state that was in economic calamity and an eleven billion dollar deficient on a twenty nine billion dollar budget. A state that had taxes and fees raised on it one hundred and fifteen times in the eight years before I became governor. A state that no longer believed that any one person could make a difference in the lives of the people of this state so we rolled up our sleeves and we went to work. And we balanced six budgets in a row. We've refused to raise taxes on the people of this state for six years. We made the hard decisions that had to be made to improve our education system, we reformed tenure for the first time in 110 years. We made the difficult decisions to reform pension and health benefits and we continue that fight today. We have stood together against each and every person, every cynic who said why are you wasting your time the state is not governable. The last six years we proved not only can you govern this state, you can lead it to a better day and that's what we've done together. And now we face a country. We face a country that's not angry. When I hear the media say that our country is angry, I know they're wrong. The last year I went to thirty seven different states across this country in one year and I met people in every corner of America. And they are not angry. Americans are not angry, Americans are filled with anxiety. They're filled with anxiety because they look to Washington DC and they see a government that not only doesn't work anymore, it doesn't even talk to each other anymore. It doesn't even try to pretend to work anymore. We have a president in the oval office who ignores the congress and a congress that ignores the president. We need a Washington DC that remembers you went there to work for us not the other way around. And both parties. Both parties have failed our country. Both parties have stood in the corner and held their breath and waited to get their own way. And both parties have lead us to believe that in America, a country that was built on compromise, that somehow now compromise is a dirty word. If Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed compromise was a dirty word, we'd still be under the crown of England. And this, this dysfunction, this lack of leadership, has lead to an economy that is weak and hasn't recovered the way it should. It's lead to an educational system that has us 27th in the industrialized world in Math and 24th in science. It's lead us, it's lead us to weak leadership around the world where our friends no longer trust us and our adversaries no longer fear us. This weakness and indecisiveness in the oval office has sent a wave of anxiety through our country, but I'm hear to tell you that anxiety can be swept away by strong leadership and decisiveness to lead America again. We just need to have the courage to choose. We just need to have the courage to stand up and say enough. We need to have the courage to course a new path for America. America knows that new path, it knows where it needs to go and it must start with this. We must tell each other the truth about the problems we have and about the difficulty of the solutions, but if we tell each other the truth everybody, if we recognize the truth and hard decisions today will lead to growth and opportunity tomorrow for every American in this country. What are those truths? What are those truths? We have to acknowledge that the government isn't working anymore for us. We have to acknowledge that and say it out loud and we have to acknowledge that it is the fault of our bickering leaders in Washington DC who no longer listen to us and no longer know that they're supposed to be serving us. We need to acknowledge that all of that anxiety and those failures are not the end, they're the beginning. The beginning of what we can do together. What we need to decide is that we can make a difference. That we can stand up and make a difference in this country. You see, that's why I love the job that I have. That's why I love my job as governor because kids ask me all the time. The forth graders that come to statehouse every week, they ask me.. the two questions that are always asked. One, what's your favorite color? Always. Second, they always ask me what's your best part of your job. And I always tell them it's that I wake up every morning knowing that I have an opportunity to do something great. I don't do something great every day, I'm human. But every morning I wake up with an opportunity to do something great. That's why this job is a great job and that's why President of the United States is an even greater job for an even greater number of people. I have spent the last thirteen years of my life as US Attorney and governor of this state fighting for fairness and justice and opportunity for the people of the state of New Jersey. That fight has not made me more weary, it has made me stronger and I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America. America is tired of handwringing and indecisiveness and weakness in the oval office. We need to have strength and decision making and authority back in the oval office and that is why today I am proud to announce my candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States of America. And now, as Livingston New Jersey turns it's gaze to the rest of America today, what do we see and what do we have to confront? We need a campaign of big ideas and hard truths and real opportunity for the America people. We need to fix a broken entitlement system that is bankrupting our country. We have candidates that say we cannot confront, because if we do we'll be lying and stealing from the American people. Let me fill everyone else in, the lying and stealing has already happened. The horse is already out of the barn. We've got to get it back in and you can only do it by force. We need to get our economy growing again at four percent or greater and the reason we do is because we have to make this once again the country that my mother and father told me it was. That as hard as you work, that's as hard and high as you'll rise. That's not the case anymore, we can't honestly look at our children and say that to them. Because we have an economy that is weak and doesn't present them with the same opportunities that Mary Pat and I were presented with in the mid 1980s when we graduated from college. When we graduated from college, we weren't worried about finding a job, we were worried about picking which job was the best for us. We didn't worry about whether we were going to be successful; we knew if we worked hard we were going to be successful. This country and it's leadership owes the same thing to my children and yours I'm ready to give it to you. We need a tax system. We need a tax system that's simplified and won't put CPA's like my dad out of business. We need to get the government off the back of our people and businesses with regulations and we need to encourage businesses to invest in America again, not overseas. Invest in our country and our people. And in a world that is as dangerous. As dangerous as frightening as I've seen it in my lifetime, there is only one indispensable force for good in the world. And it is a strong, unequivocal, America, that will lead the world and not be afraid to tell our friends we'll be with you no matter what. And to tell our adversaries that there are limits to your conduct and America will enforce the limits to that conduct. Well, here it comes. After seven years. After seven years, I heard the President of the United States say the other day that the world respects America more because of his leadership. This convinces me, this convinces me. This is the final confirmation that President Obama lives in his own world, not in our world. And the fact is this. After seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy, run by Barack Obama, we'd better not turn it over to his second mate Hilary Clinton. In the end. In the end, everybody, leadership matters. It matters for our country, and American leadership matters for the world. But if we're going to lead, we have to stop worrying about being loved and start caring about being respected again at home and around the world. I am not running for president of the United States as a surrogate for being prom king of America. I am not looking to be the most popular guy who looks in your eyes every day and tries to figure out what you want to hear, say it and then turning around and doing something else. When I stand up on a stage like this in front of all of you there is one thing you will know for sure, I mean what I say and I say what I mean and that's what America needs right now. And unlike some people who offer themselves for the presidency in 2016, you're not going to have to wonder whether I can do it or not. In New Jersey as governor, I've stood up against economic calamity and unprecedented natural disaster. We have brought ourselves together, we have pushed back that economic calamity and we are recovering from that natural disaster and that's because we've lead and we've worked together to do it. As governor, I've proven that you can stand up and fight the most powerful special interest this state has to have and stand up and stop them, but at the same time reach across the aisle to our friends in the democratic party and say if you have a good idea I'm willing to work with you because that's what our country needs. And as governor, I've never wavered for telling you the truth as I see it and then acting to make sure that know that is the truth as I believe it in my heart. You know, as a candidate for president, I want to promise you just a few things. First, a campaign without spin, without pandering or focus group tested answers. You're going to get what I think whether you like it or not or whether it makes you cringe every once and a while or not. A campaign when I'm asked a question, I'm going to give the answer to the question that's asked, not the answer that my political consultants told me to give back stage. A campaign that every day will not worry about what is popular, but what is right. Because what is right is what will fix America, not what's popular. A campaign that believes. That believes in an America that is great as the hopes and dreams that we want every one of our children to have. Not a campaign that tears people down, but a campaign that rebuilds America to the place where you and I grew up and where we want our children to grow up in again and where we want free people around the world to grow up in in their countries as well, that's what America's always stood for and that's what this campaign will stand for. And all the signs say "Telling it like it is," but there's a reason for that. We are going to tell it like it is today so that we can create greater opportunities for every American tomorrow. The truth will set us free, every body. All the years, all 52 years that I've spent in this state with our people have prepared me for this moment. We have no idea where and how this journey will end. But we know that it's only in this country, only in America, where someone like me could have the opportunity to seek the highest office the world has to offer. Only in America, could all of you believe that your voices and your efforts can make a difference and change a country as big and vast and powerful as this one. Only in America, only in America have we seen time after time after time, the truth of the words that one person can make a difference. You see, the reason that's true is because it's the only thing that's ever made a difference in the history of the world. One person, reaching out to another to change their circumstance and to improve the lot of their children and grandchildren. I don't see the presidency, for any other reason than because I believe in my heart that I am ready to work with you to restore America to it's rightful place in the world and to restore the American dream to each one of our children if they live in Livingston, Mendham, Newark or Camden. Paterson or Jersey City. No matter where they live across this country, we need to make sure that every one of children believes that their president who not only speaks to them, but who hears them, who hears them and understands that their voices is what makes any American president great. If you give me the privilege to be your president, I will wake up every day, not only with my heart strong and my mind sharp, but with my ears open and my arms open. To welcome the American people no matter what party, no matter what race or creed or color to make sure that you know that this is your country too. We are going to go and win this election and I love each and every one of you. Thank you. I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back. We have come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank, the special interests that are more concerned with their personal welfare than the general welfare. The Washington machine that gobbles up our freedoms and invades every nook and cranny of our lives must be stopped. Less than five years ago I stood just down the road in home town in Bowling Green and said those same words. I wasn't supposed to win, no one thought I would. Some people asked me, then why are you running? The answer is the same now as it was then. I have a vision for America. I want to be part of a return to prosperity, a true economic boom that lists all Americans, a return to a government restrained by the Constitution. A return to privacy, opportunity, liberty. Too often when Republicans have won we have squandered our victory by becoming part of the Washington machine. That's not who I am. That's not why I ran for office the first time just a few years ago. The truth is, I love my life as a small town doctor. Every day I woke up, I felt lucky to be able to do the things I loved. More importantly, I was blessed to be able to do things that made a difference in people's lives. Take the Quiz: Who Said It: Ron or Rand Paul? I never could have done any of this, though, without the help of my parents who are here today. I'd like you to join me and thank my mother and dad. With my parents' help, I was able to make it through long years of medical training to become an eye surgeon. For me there is nothing that compares with helping someone see better. Last August I was privileged to travel to Guatemala on a medical mission trip together with a team of surgeons from across the US. We operated on more than 200 people who were blind or nearly blind from cataracts. I was grateful to be able to put my scrubs back on, peer into the oculars of the microscope, and focus on the task at hand, to take a surgical approach to fix a problem. One day in Guatemala, a man arrived and told me that I'd operated on his wife the day before. His wife could see clearly for the first time in years, and she had begged him to get on the bus, travel the winding roads and come back to our surgery center. He too was nearly blind from hardened cataracts. After his surgery, the next day, his wife sat next to me. As I unveiled the patch from his eyes, it was a powerful emotional moment for me to see them looking at each other clearly for the first time years to see the face they loved again. As I saw the joy in their eyes, I thought, This is why I became a doctor. In that moment, I also remembered my grandmother, who inspired me to become an eye surgeon. She spent hours with me as a kid. We would sort through her old coin collection, looking for wheat pennies and Indian heads. But as her vision began to fail, I became her eyes to inspect the faintness of the mint marks on the old weather worn coins. I went with my grandmother to the ophthalmologist as she had her corneas replaced. I was also with her when she received the sad news that macular generation had done irreparable harm to her eyes. My hope my hope that my grandmother would see again made me want to become an eye surgeon, to make a difference in people's lives. I've been fortunate. I've been able to enjoy the American Dream. I worry, though, that the opportunity and hope are slipping away for our sons and daughters. As I watch our once great economy collapse under mounting spending and debt, I think, What kind of America will our grandchildren see? It seems to me that both parties and the entire political system are to blame. Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration. And it's now tripling under Barack Obama's watch. President Obama is on course to add more debt than all of the previous presidents combined. We borrow a million dollars a minute. This vast accumulation of debt threatens not just our economy, but our security. We can wake up now and do the right thing. Quit spending money we don't have. This message of liberty is for all Americans, Americans from all walks of life. The message of liberty, opportunity and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor. In order to restore America, one thing is for certain, though: We cannot, we must not dilute our message or give up on our principles. If we nominate a candidate who is simply Democrat Light, what's the point? Why bother? We need to boldly proclaim our vision for America. We need to go boldly forth under the banner of liberty that clutches the Constitution in one hand and the Bill of Rights in the other. Washington is horribly broken. I fear it can't be fixed from within. We the people must rise up and demand action. Congress will never balance the budget unless you force them to do so. Congress has an abysmal record with balancing anything. Our only recourse is to force Congress to balance the budget with a constitutional amendment. I have been to Washington, and let me tell you, there is no monopoly on knowledge there. I ran for office because we have too many career politicians. I believe it now more than ever. We limit the President to two terms. It's about time we limit the terms of Congress! I want to reform Washington. I want common sense rules that will break the logjam in Congress. That's why I introduced a Read the Bills Act. The bills are thousands of pages long. And no one reads them. They are often plopped on our desks only a few hours before a vote. I've proposed something truly extraordinary, Let's read the bills, every page! The bills are 1000 pages long and no one reads them. They are often plopped on our desk with only a few hours before a vote, so I propose something truly extraordinary. Let's read the bills every day. From the time I was a very young boy I was taught to love and appreciate America. Love of liberty pulses in my veins not because we have beautiful mountains or white sand beaches, although we do, and not because of our abundance of resources. It's more visceral than that. Our great nation was founded upon the extraordinary notion that government should be restrained and freedom should be maximized. America, to me, is that beacon. We are unique among the nations that our, that our country stands for freedom. Freedom nurtured our country from a rebellious group of colonies into the world's greatest nation. When tyranny threatened the world America led the way to rid the world of Nazis and fascist regimes. Resolutely we stood decade after decade against Communism, the engine of capitalism finally winning out against the sputtering, incompetent engine of socialism. We won the Cold War. America and freedom are so intertwined that people literally are dying to come here. The freedom we have fostered in America have unleashed genius and advancement like never before. Yet our great nation still needs new ideas and new answers to old problems. From an early age I worked. I taught swimming lessons, I mowed lawns, I did landscaping, I put roofs on houses, I painted houses. I never saw work though as punishment. Who always gave me a sense of who I am. Self esteem cant be given; it must be earned. Work is not punishment; work is the reward. Two of my sons work minimum wage jobs while they go to college. I am proud of them as I see them realize the value of hard work. I can see their self esteem grow as they cash their paychecks. I have a vision for America where everyone who wants to work will have a job. Many Americans though are being left behind. The reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties, the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer. Trillion dollar government stimulus packages has only widened the income gap. Politically connected crones get taxpayer dollars by the hundreds of millions and poor families across America continue to suffer. I have a different vision, an ambitious vision, an ambitious vision, a vision that will offer opportunity to all Americans, especially those who have been left behind. My plan includes economic freedom zones to allow impoverished areas like Detroit, West Louisville, Eastern Kentucky to prosper by leaving more money in the pockets of the people who live there. Can you imagine what a billion dollar stimulus could do for Detroit or for Appalachia? I'm convinced that most Americans want to work. I want to free up the great engine of American prosperity. I want to see millions of Americans back at work. In my vision for America, we'll bring back manufacturing jobs that pay well. How? We'll dramatically lower the tax on American companies that wish to bring their profits home. More than $2 trillion in American profit currently sits overseas. In my vision for America, new highways and bridges will be built across the country, not by raising your taxes, but by lowering the tax to bring this American profit home. Even in this polarized Congress, we have a chance of passing this. I say let's bring $2 trillion home to America, let's bring it home now. Liberal policies have failed our inner cities. Let's just get the facts straight. They have failed our inner cities. Our schools are not equal, and the poverty gap continues to widen. Martin Luther King spoke of two Americas. He described them as two starkly different American experiences that exist side by side. In one in America, people experience the opportunity of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In the other America, people experience a daily ugliness that dashes hope and leaves only the fatigue of despair. Although I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity, my trips to Detroit, to Appalachia, to Chicago have revealed what I call an undercurrent of unease. It's time for a new way, a way predicated on justice, opportunity and freedom. Those of us who have enjoyed the American dream must break down the wall that separates us from the other America. I want all our children to have the same opportunities that I had. We need to stop limiting kids in poor neighborhoods to failing public schools and offer them school choice. It won't happen, though, unless we realize that we can't borrow our way to prosperity. Currently some $3 trillion comes into the US Treasury. Couldn't the country just survive on $3 trillion? I propose we do something extraordinary. Let's just spend what comes in. In my vision for America, freedom and prosperity at home can only be achieved if we defend against enemies who are dead set on attacking us. Without question we must defend ourselves and American interests from our enemies, but until we name the enemy, we can't win the war. The enemy is radical Islam. You can't get around it. And not only will I name the enemy, I will do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind. We need a national defense robust enough to defend against all attack, modern enough to deter all enemies, and nimble enough to defend our vital interests. But we also need a foreign policy that protects American interests and encourages stability, not chaos. At home, conservatives understand that government is the problem, not the solution. Conservatives should not succumb, though, to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow succeed in building nations abroad. I envision an America with a national defense unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by overseas nation building. I envision a national defense that promotes, as Reagan put it, peace through strength. I believe in applying Reagan's approach to foreign policy to the Iran issue. Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength. We've brought Iran to the table through sanctions that I voted for. Now we must stay strong. That's why I've cosponsored legislation that ensures that any deal between the US and Iran must be approved by Congress. Not, not only is that good policy, it's the law. It concerns me that the Iranians have a different interpretation of the agreement. They're putting out statement that say completely the opposite of what we're saying. It concerns me that we may attempt, or the president may attempt, to unilaterally and prematurely halt sanctions. I will oppose any deal that does not end Iran's nuclear ambitions and have strong verification measures. And I will insist that the final version be brought before Congress. The difference between President Obama and myself, he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness. Yet everyone needs to realize that negotiations are not inherently bad. The trust verify is required in any negotiation, but then our goal always should be and always is peace, not war. We must realize, though, that we do not project strength by borrowing money from China to send it to Pakistan. Let's quit building bridges in foreign countries and use that money to build some bridges here at home. It angers me to see mobs burning our flag and chanting Death to America in countries that receive millions of dollars in our foreign aid. I say it must end. I say not one penny more to these haters of America. To defend our country, we do need to gather intelligence on the enemy. But when the intelligence director is not punished for lying under oath, how are we to trust our government agencies? Warrantless searches of Americans' phones and computer records are un American and a threat to our civil liberties. I say that your phone records are yours. I say the phone records of law abiding citizens are none of their damn business. Is this where we light up the phones? The president created this vast dragnet by executive order. And as president on day one, I will immediately end this unconstitutional surveillance. I believe we can have liberty and security and I will not compromise your liberty for a false sense of security, not now, not ever. We must defend ourselves, but we must never give up who we are as a people. We must never diminish the Bill of Rights as we fight this long war against evil. We must believe in our founding documents. We must protect economic and personal liberty again. America has much greatness left in her. We are still exceptional and we are still a beacon for the world. We will thrive when we believe in ourselves again. I see an America strong enough to deter foreign aggression, yet wise enough to avoid unnecessary intervention. I see an America where criminal justice is applied equally and any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color is repealed. I see an America with a restrained IRS that cannot target, cannot harass American citizens for their political or religious beliefs. I see our big cities once again shining and beckoning with creativity and ingenuity, with American companies offering American jobs. With your help, this message will ring from coast to coast, a message of liberty, justice and personal responsibility. Today begins the journey to take America back. To rescue a great country now adrift, join me as together we seek a new vision for America. Today I announce with God's help, with the help of liberty lovers everywhere, that I am putting myself forward as a candidate for president of the United States of America. Can you believe we had trouble getting, or the Democrats had trouble getting God into the platform? Sounds like there wasn't much dissension out here on the vote, though. You may have heard there was a little girl, and she wanted a hundred dollars, and she said she'd do good things with it. So she wrote a letter. She said, dear God, I'd like a hundred dollars. The postmaster got it, and he said, I don't know what to do with it. So he sent it to the president. And the president said, well, that's cute. And he said to his secretary, send the little girl $5; she'll appreciate that. So the little girl got it and was, like, five bucks. But her parents told her, always write a thank you. And so she did. She said, dear God, thanks for the five bucks, but next time, don't send it through Washington; they stole 95 percent of it. We are now in the midst of an election that pits one party against another. But I often tell people political parties are empty vessels unless we imbue them with values. Republicans must first decide and clearly explain who we are before we can ask to take charge of the country. Today we are here to talk about what we believe those values should be. I'm a Christian, a husband and a father. I'm faithful to my wife and my family. I try to be good at all those things, though, of course, we all fall short of perfection in our lives. I try to adhere to the tenets of God's word in the New Testament. I take seriously my oath to defend the Constitution. And I try to fight for truth and my values regardless of the political outcome, regardless of how popular or unpopular they may be. Dostoevsky wrote that I did not arrive at my hosanna through childlike faith, but through a fiery furnace of doubt. My faith has never been easy for me, never been easy to talk about and never been without obstacles. I do not and cannot wear my religion on my sleeve. I am a Christian but not always a good one. I'm not completely free of doubts. I struggle to understand man's inhumanity to man. I struggle to understand the horrible tragedies that war inflicts on our young men and women. And I've always had trouble grappling with the tragedies that I've encountered in medicine. As a medical student and as a physician, I struggled and struggle with inexplicable disease, terminal tumors in children. When bad things happen to good people, when bad things happen to innocent people, when Mrs. Jones presents with pancreatic cancer, I don't always know what to say or what to think. You can see it in her eyes. She knows what the diagnosis ultimately means. How do you explain something so unjust and inexplicable to her? My first patient as a medical student on the surgical service was a beautiful young woman who unfortunately presented with metastatic melanoma to her ovaries. She didn't die during my time caring for her, but I knew enough to know that her time was limited. And I struggled to understand her tragedy and how tragedy could occur in a world that has purpose and design. Like most doctors or like most people, really, I struggle with sometimes caring too much and sometimes caring too little. I struggle to understand how evil individuals sometimes reap earthly rewards and saintly heroes are martyred by their fellow man. When I read All Quiet on the Western Front, I recoiled at the horror of war. When I read of the merciless and relentless charges from one trench to another and the utter carnage, I wondered whose grand design is this. When I read Silent Night, the story of Christmas, of the Christmas Eve armistice, I marveled at men who found goodness so profound that it overcame hatred. I was awestruck by soldiers who put down their arms to sing Christmas carols with the enemy and came out of their trenches to play soccer and exchange small gifts. I was amazed at men who were so transformed by the moment that they were left unable to fight and had to be transferred away from the front lines. This is from World War I. I realize, though, that the Christmas armistice was an anomaly and that millions died in World War I and World War II and all the 20th century wars, despite the fact that few, in any, of the soldiers involved knew enough of their foe to want to kill them or befriend them. I'm not a pacifist, but I do think it unacceptable not to hate war. I'm dismissive of those who champion war as sport and show no reluctance to engage in war. Any leader who shows glee or eagerness for war should not be leading any nation. I believe truly great leaders are reluctant to go to war and try mightily to avoid war. Though I detest violence, I could kill someone who injured or threatened my family. Though I hate war, I could commit a nation to war, but only reluctantly and constitutionally and after great deliberation. I believe that though some would find this a contradiction in terms that there is a such thing as a Christian or just theory of war, that a just war is a war of self defense. At the same time I'm conflicted. I don't believe Jesus would have killed anyone or condoned killing, perhaps not even in self defense. I'm conflicted. The coarsening of our culture towards violent death has more consequences than even war. Tragically, this same culture has led to the death of 50 million unborn children in the last 40 years. I don't think a civilization can long endure that does not have respect for all human life, born and not yet born. We have a great many problems in this country to solve. But I believe there will come a time when we are all judged on whether or not we took a stand in defense of all life from the moment of conception until our last natural breath. As a teenager, I gave my first public speech in my church. I wasn't very good. I hope I'm getting better. I would think at the time I was awful. My hands shook. My heart pounded. I don't think I'm a natural with this. I thought to myself, I can't do this. But somehow I did. And because I wanted to talk about things that were important, I persisted. I chided my church as a senior in high school for not seeming to care about the not yet born, for looking the other way and for not taking a stand on life. One thing I promise you and I promise my constituents in Kentucky is, I will always take a stand for life. Though I believe in limited powers for the federal government, I believe, as our founders did, that primary among these powers and duties is the protection of life, that government cannot protect liberty if it does not first protect life. Ultimately, , ultimately, as Christians, our message should be a message of hope. We need leadership who can find hope and optimism amidst the fiscal crisis we face. We need leaders who can transform the coldness of austerity into the warm embrace of prosperity. We need leaders who can extol the American dream, who are proud of America, who will convince us to believe in ourselves again. We must embrace the values of life, liberty and prosperity that will lead this country back to greatness. And we should do so proudly as Christians. I agree with Ralph Reed, who often states that the First Amendment is here to keep government out of religion, but not to keep religious people out of government. Our success in this battle will be measured in many ways. Do we stand for principles in our battles? Do we stand with leaders and politicians who embody our principles? And finally and most importantly, do we keep our humanity and our values intact as we fight the good fight? Ultimately, our success in life is measured in man's humanity toward man. I'm not asking you to love man in the abstract. I'm not asking you to love someone else's neighbor. I'm saying that what is important is to love your neighbor, but even more importantly, but even more importantly, to love the people close to you. Success or happiness or whatever you want to call it is in the particulars. It's not in the abstract. It's sitting right next to you. Loving a man or woman in particular might find you happiness. Your interactions with those you know, with those you love is where you should look. In that realm I believe may lie the key to success and the key to happiness while we're here on earth. For me, my serendipity, my discovery happened not in any lab, not in medicine, not in politics. I didn't discover the cure for some horrible disease. I haven't yet solved the world's problems in politics, but just wait, I'm trying. But once upon a time I did come serendipitously upon a girl at an oyster roast, a girl who makes every achievement I might have or not have important. No matter where you are, what your path is, what path you choose, don't lose track of what are the important things. The important things are the people you know, the shared experiences of the ones you love. And all that ultimately matters, as you chart your course, as we all try to chart our course in life, is how you treat the people around you, particularly those closest to you. All else in life ultimately withers and fades. Each of us today must examine what is important in your life. For me, it can be summed up in a dedication from my book that I wrote, and this dedication was for my wife: What are the important things? Scratch my head, silence enough to hear my watch tick. Time, have I time to even consider what are the important things? Even when I sit still, I sit still in a hurry. But beyond, between and above all else, you, the girl, my wife, my love, can and do complete all syllogisms my circular brain can create. For me, you are the important things. For us, as a nation, as a people, we need to decide what are the important things. They're not all in politics. They're not all here in present that we can fully understand them. I think there is crisis in our country. It's not just a fiscal crisis. I think it's a moral crisis. I think it's a spiritual crisis. I don't think the answer is in any politician. I don't think the answer is in any particular law. I think the answer really is that we need to somehow find our way back to God, find our way back. And I think we find that by taking the time from our busy lives, from everything around us, taking the time to reflect what are the important things. I hope we will find that out, I hope we will reflect, and I hope we will find spiritual renewal as a country and a people. Today I want to talk with you about the promise of America. Imagine your parents when they were children. Imagine a little girl growing up in Wilmington, Delaware during World War II, the daughter of Irish and Italian Catholic family, working class. Her uncle ran numbers in Wilmington. She grew up with dozens of cousins because her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids. She had a difficult father, a man who drank far too much, and frankly didn't think that women should be educated. And yet this young girl, pretty and shy, was driven, was bright, was inquisitive, and she became the first person in her family ever to go to college. In 1956, my mom, Eleanor, graduated from Rice University with a degree in math and became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s and 1960s. Imagine a teenage boy, not much younger than many of you here today, growing up in Cuba. Jet black hair, skinny as a rail. Involved in student council, and yet Cuba was not at a peaceful time. The dictator, Batista, was corrupt, he was oppressive. And this teenage boy joins a revolution. He joins a revolution against Batista, he begins fighting with other teenagers to free Cuba from the dictator. This boy at age 17 finds himself thrown in prison, finds himself tortured, beaten. And then at age 18, he flees Cuba, he comes to America. Imagine for a second the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to Key West, and got on a Greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas to begin working, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour, coming to the one land on earth that has welcomed so many millions. When my dad came to America in 1957, he could not have imagined what lay in store for him. Imagine a young married couple, living together in the 1970s, neither one of them has a personal relationship with Jesus. They have a little boy and they are both drinking far too much. They are living a fast life. When I was three, my father decided to leave my mother and me. We were living in Calgary at the time, he got on a plane and he flew back to Texas, and he decided he didn't want to be married anymore and he didn't want to be a father to his 3 year old son. And yet when he was in Houston, a friend, a colleague from the oil and gas business invited him to a Bible study, invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church, and there my father gave his life to Jesus Christ. And God transformed his heart. And he drove to the airport, he bough a plane ticket, and he flew back to be with my mother and me. There are people who wonder if faith is real. I can tell you, in my family there's not a second of doubt, because were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been saved and I would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household. Imagine another little girl living in Africa, in Kenya and Nigeria. That's a diverse crowd. Playing with kids, they spoke Swahili, she spoke English. Coming back to California. Where her parents who had been missionaries in Africa raised her on the Central Coast. She starts a small business when she's in grade school baking bread. She calls it Heidi's Bakery. She and her brother compete baking bread. They bake thousands of loaves of bread and go to the local apple orchard where they sell the bread to people coming to pick apples. She goes on to a career in business, excelling and rising to the highest pinnacles, and then Heidi becomes my wife and my very best friend in the world. Heidi becomes an incredible mom to our two precious little girls, Caroline and Catherine, the joys and loves of our life. Imagine another teenage boy being raised in Houston, hearing stories from his dad about prison and torture in Cuba, hearing stories about how fragile liberty is, beginning to study the United States Constitution, learning about the incredible protections we have in this country that protect the god given liberty of every American. Experiencing challenges at home. In the 1980s, oil prices crater and his parents business go bankrupt. Heading off to school over a thousand miles away from home, in a place where he knew nobody, where he was alone and scared, and his parents going through bankruptcy meant there was no financial support at home, so at the age of 17, he went to get two jobs to help pay his way through school. He took over $100000 in school loans, loans I suspect a lot of ya'll can relate to, loans that I'll point out I just paid off a few years ago. These are all of our stories. These are who we are as Americans. And yet, for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant. What is the promise of America? The idea that, the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon, which is that our rights don't come from man. They come from God Almighty. And that the purpose of the Constitution, as Thomas Jefferson put it, is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government. The incredible opportunity of the American dream, what has enabled millions of people from all over the world to come to America with nothing and to achieve anything. And then the American exceptionalism that has made this nation a clarion voice for freedom in the world, a shining city on a hill. That's the promise of America. That is what makes this nation an indispensable nation, a unique nation in the history of the world. And yet, so many fear that that promise is today unattainable. So many fear it is slipping away from our hands. I want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of America: 240 years ago on this very day, a 38 year old lawyer named Patrick Henry stood up just a hundred miles from here in Richmond, Virginia and said, Give me liberty or give me death. I want to ask each of you to imagine, imagine millions of courageous conservatives, all across America, rising up together to say in unison we demand our liberty. Today, roughly half of born again Christians aren't voting. They're staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values. Today millions of young people are scared, worried about the future, worried about what the future will hold. Imagine millions of young people coming together and standing together, saying we will stand for liberty. Think just how different the world would be. Imagine instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth. Instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers, imagine small businesses growing and prospering. Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers. Imagine innovation thriving on the Internet as government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay and more and more opportunity is created. Imagine America finally becoming energy self sufficient as millions and millions of high paying jobs are created. Five years ago today, the president signed Obamacare into law. Within hours, Liberty University went to court filing a lawsuit to stop that failed law. Instead of the joblessness, instead of the millions forced into part time work, instead of the millions who've lost their health insurance, lost their doctors, have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums, imagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare. Imagine health care reform that keeps government out of the way between you and your doctor and that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation, that imposes burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple flat tax that lets every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard. Imagine abolishing the IRS. Instead of the lawlessness and the president's unconstitutional executive amnesty, imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders. And imagine a legal immigration system that welcomes and celebrates those who come to achieve the American dream. Instead of a federal government that wages an assault on our religious liberty, that goes after Hobby Lobby, that goes after the Little Sisters of the Poor, that goes after Liberty University, imagine a federal government that stands for the First Amendment rights of every American. Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage. Instead of a government that works to undermine our Second Amendment rights, that seeks to ban our ammunition imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law abiding Americans. Instead of a government that seizes your emails and your cell phones, imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every American. Instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through Common Core imagine repealing every word of Common Core. Imagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation that every single child, regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of wealth or ZIP Code, every child in America has the right to a quality education. And that's true from all of the above, whether is public schools, or charter schools, or private schools, or Christian schools, or parochial schools, or home schools, every child. Instead of a president who boycotts Prime Minister Netanyahu, imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel. Instead of a president who seeks to go to the United Nations to end run Congress and the American people imagine a president who says I will honor the Constitution, and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. Imagine a president who says We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will call it by its name. Now, all of these seem difficult, indeed to some they may seem unimaginable, and yet if you look in the history of our country, imagine it's 1775, and you and I were sitting there in Richmond listening to Patrick Henry say give me liberty or give me death. Imagine it's 1776 and we were watching the 54 signers of the Declaration of Independence stand together and pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to igniting the promise of America. Imagine it was 1777 and we were watching General Washington as he lost battle, after battle, after battle in the freezing cold as his soldiers with no shoes were dying, fighting for freedom against the most powerful army in the world. That, too, seemed unimaginable. Imagine it's 1933 and we were listening to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tell America at a time of crushing depression, at a time of a gathering storm abroad, that we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Imagine it's 1979 and you and I were listening to Ronald Reagan. And he was telling us that we would cut the top marginal tax rates from 70 percent all the way down to 28 percent, that we would go from crushing stagnation to booming economic growth, to millions being lifted out of poverty and into prosperity abundance. That the very day that he was sworn in, our hostages who were languishing in Iran would be released. And that within a decade we would win the Cold War and tear the Berlin Wall to the ground. That would have seemed unimaginable, and yet, with the grace of God, that's exactly what happened. From the dawn of this country, at every stage America has enjoyed God's providential blessing. Over and over again, when we face impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge. You know, compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS ain't all that tough. The power of the American people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds. If you're ready to join a grassroots army across this nation, coming together and standing for liberty, I'm going to ask you to break a rule here today and to take out your cell phones, and to text the word constitution to the number 33733. You can also text imagine. We're versatile. Once again, text constitution to 33733. God's blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn't done with America yet. I believe in you. I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America, and that is why today I am announcing that I'm running for president of the United States. It is a time for truth. It is a time for liberty. It is a time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States. I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children's children. We stand together for liberty. This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution. It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America. God bless the Values Voter Summitso I gotta ask, what are these things? Is Barack Obama coming? Let me say thank you to my friend Jim Bridenstine. What an incredible, powerful, fighting conservative. There's an ancient Chinese curse: May you live in interesting times. These are interesting times. Yesterday, Pope Francis was in Washington. Wonderful to welcome him here. I have to say, the press conference was a little awkward because every time the reporters addressed a question to your Holiness, Barack Obama answered. And then today, the President of China, President Xi is in town. Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world's most powerful communist, and the president of China. How many of y'all have watched the Republican debates? How fantastic is it that we have such an array of young, charismatic, talented, principled leaders stepping forward to lead this party and this country? And what a contrast with the Democrats. I'm pretty sure the first Democratic debate is going to consist of Hillary Clinton and the Chipotle clerk. It is amazing to watch the Democrats as they keep moving their debates. First it was going to be August. Then it was going to be September, then it was October. They may move it to 2017. In a few months, we may see the first presidential debate in Leavenworth. If they can project a rainbow on the White House, maybe they can put bars on the windows. I'll tell you, it's not widely know, they had planned to have an earlier Democratic debate. The problem was, the debate invitation was emailed to Hillary. I am so honored to be back with so many friends today. I want to say, my friend Tony Perkins, the Family Research Council, does incredible work in this country. You want to talk about a strong, principled conservative, who scares the living daylights out of Washington, but I have to tell you, Tony doesn't scare Washington nearly as much as the men and women gathered in this ballroom. You want to know how much each of you terrify Washington? Yesterday, John Boehner was Speaker of the House. Y'all come to town, and somehow that changes. My only request, is can you come more often? Tony, we need to schedule these weekly. Once a week. Listen, every one of us, we know our country is in crisis. We know that this isn't a typical time in politics. We're bankrupting our kids and grandkids. Our Constitutional rights are under assault, each and every day from Washington. As America has receded from leadership in the world, it is making the world a much more dangerous place, but I want to come to you this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation all across this country, the American people are waking up, and I'll tell you today, help is on the way. I want to ask everyone here to look forward, look forward to January 2017. If I am elected president, let me tell you what I'll do on the first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional Executive Action. The president tells us he has a phone and he has a pen, well you live by the pen, you die by the pen. My pen has got an eraser. Sadly, the corruption's not been limited to the White House. It has extended across every agency of the federal government, and the second thing I intend to do on my first day in office is to instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos, and to prosecute any and all criminal conduct by that organization. The administration of justice should be blind to party or ideology. The only fidelity of the Department of Justice should be to the laws and the Constitution of the United States of America. The third thing I intend to do on the first day in office is to instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS, and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends TODAY! That means that every service man and woman can worship the Lord God Almighty, with all of his heart, mind and soul, and his Commanding Officer has nothing to say about it. That means the Little Sisters of the Poor, who Pope Francis visited this week, will find that the case against them has been dismissed. You know, Kim Davis is here. Just a couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit Kim in a Kentucky jailhouse. Now six months, a year ago, if I had come and said that a Christian woman was going to be thrown in jail, locked up in jail for living her faith, the media would have dismissed me as a nutcase. That's where we are today. Kim and I embraced, and I told her, I said 'Kim, thank you. You are inspiring millions across this country by standing for your faith.' The Book of Acts tells us that when Paul and Cyrus were in jail that God brought an earthquake and broke open the jail cell. What I told Kim is that you are being lifted up in prayer by millions of believers across America, and across the world. You may have thought you were alone in that jail cell, but you didn't understand how crowded it was. And I'll tell you Kim's very simple response. She smiled and pointed up and said 'to God be the glory.' The fourth thing I intend to do on the first day in office, is to rip to shreds, this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. The single greatest national security threat facing America is the threat of a nuclear Iran. I gotta tell you, I can't wait to stand on a debate stage next to Hillary Clinton, and to make very clear to the American people, if you vote for Hillary Clinton, you are voting for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants Death to America, under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. If the Ayatollah doesn't understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy two virgins. The fifth thing I intend to do on the first day of office is begin the process of moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Jerusalem. That's Day One! There are 365 days in a year. Four years in a presidential term. Four years in a second term. By the end of eight years, this ballroom is going to be a whole lot bigger. By the end of eight years there's going to be a whole of reporters and journalists who check themselves into therapy. In the days that follow, I will go to Congress and we will repeal every word of Obamacare. In the days that follow I will instruct the federal Department of Education, which should be abolished, that Common Core ends today. In the days that follow, we will honor our military. We will honor the commitments made to our Soldiers and Sailors, and Airmen and Marines, and we will protect our service members right to keep and bear arms and defend themselves. That means, the next time a jihadist walks into a recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, he's going to encounter the business end of firearms wielded by a dozen Marines. In the days that follow, we finally, finally, finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities. We will stop the indefensible practice of releasing violent criminal illegal aliens. We will pass Kate's Law. In the days that follow, we will take on the EPA and the CFPB, and the alphabet soup of government agencies that strangle small businesses, and we will unleash booming economic growth. In the days that follow, I will go to Congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform and we will pass a simple flat tax where every American can fill out his or her taxes on post card. When we do that, we should abolish the IRS. Some of you may be thinking, that makes common sense to me. Live within your means. Don't bankrupt our kids and grandkids. Follow the Constitution. But can we do it? Can it be done? Scripture tells us there is nothing new under the sun. I think where we are today is very, very much like the late 1970s. Same failed economic policies. Same misery. Stagnation and malaise. The same feckless and naive foreign policies. In fact, the exact same countries: Russia and Iran, openly laughing at, and mocking, the President of the United States. Why is it that analogy gives me so much hope and optimism? Because we know how that story ended. All across this country, millions of men and women rose up and became the Reagan Revolution. It didn't come from Washington. Washington despised Ronald Reagan. By the way, if you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run and hide. It turned this country around, and I'm here to tell you the same thing is happening again. All over this country, millions of men and women are waking up. Do you know that since this campaign has started, out of seventeen Republican candidates, you know which campaign raised the most hard money? WE DID! To date, over 300000 contributions. People all over the country coming to TedCruz. The people are waking up. Let me tell you what Washington wants. Washington wants us divided. Washington wants Conservatives split: a chunk of Evangelicals here, a chunk of Conservatives over here, a chunk of Libertarians over here, a chunk of Tea Party folks over here. That's how, if we are splintered that a moderate establishment candidate runs up the middle with 23 percent of the vote, steals the nomination and then loses to Hillary Clinton in the General Election. You know what, we've seen that movie before. I'm not interested in going to see Rocky 19. We have a simple task before us. If Conservatives unit, we win. I'm here to ask each and every one of you to stand. Stand in your faith, stand in your principles. Come together. How do we turn this country around? Just like in 1980, we rise up as We The People, and we say 'we will defend this last, best hope for mankind, this shining city on a hill, that is the United States of America.' Thank you. Alright. We have limited time. Thank you. Well thank you so much for that warm welcome. This of course is my wonderful wife Candy, who is also a Detroiter. Even though we are both from Detroit, we had to go to New Haven to meet each other. But, but Candy has been by my side now for 40 years. And is my best friend, and we do everything together. She even learned how to play pool because she knew I was a good pool player. And, you know she actually wins sometimes. But, most of the times, most of the times I beat her. But I should be careful because there are some media in here and their headline will be Carson admits he beats his wife, you know. But, if you guys wouldn't mind sitting down, so that I can introduce our sons. My oldest son, Murray and his wife Lerone are right here. Stand up, please. Murray is an engineer and Lerone is an analyst for a polling company. And my middle son BJ and his wife Merlin are right here, Ben, Jr And, BJ is an entrepreneur and Merlin owns a company that does placements and they do a lot of things, they own a lot of stuff. Very cool. And then my youngest son, Royce is right here. His wife is at home with the baby. Royce is a CPA, and they all three got married in 2011. That's right, yeah. Now, I have introduced my family. You say, well who are you? I'll tell you. I'm Ben Carson, and I'm a candidate for President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Now, America remains a place of dreams and a lot of people are down on our nation. And they want to point out all of the bad things that have happened here. But, have you ever noticed that there's a lot of people trying to get in here and not a lot of people trying to escape? You know, it says something, and it was a place of dreams for my mother. My mother came from a very large rural family in Tennessee and was shuffled from home to home. She always had a desire for education. But, she was never able to get beyond the third grade. And she married at age 13 with the hope of escaping a desperate situation. She and my father moved here to Detroit, and he worked in a factory. In fact, I remember one Christmas being right here in this auditorium, sitting right over there with, for GM employees they had a Christmas program for the kids. But, some years later, my mother discovered that he was a bigamist and had another family. And of course, that occasioned the divorce and you know she only had a third grade education. And consequently, we were thrown into a situation of dire poverty. And she still maintained that dream of education, but now it was for us, more so than for herself. We moved in with her older sister and brother in law in Boston. Typical tenement. Large, multifamily dwelling. Boarded up windows and doors, sirens, gangs, murders. Both of our older cousins, who we adored, were killed. I remember when our favorite drug dealer was killed. Vinnie Bostonbarrows He drove a blue Cadillac. You know, they used to bring us candy, so we liked to see the drug dealers. But, the rats and the roaches. You know, in the more upscale areas, they called them water bugs, but we knew what they were. But my mother was out working extraordinarily hard. Two, sometimes three, jobs at a time, as a domestic. Trying to stay off of welfare. And the reason for that was she noticed that most of the people she saw go on welfare never came off of it. And she didn't want to be dependent. She wanted us also to be independent, and she decided she would work as long and as hard as necessary, leaving at 5:00 in the morning, getting back after midnight, day after day after day, doing what other people didn't want to do to try and maintain her independence. And she was very thrifty. I mean she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound. And then she would go and collect all of her dimes and nickels and quarters and buy a new car. And people would say, how does that woman afford a new car? But, she knew how to manage money. And I am fond of saying if my mother were Secretary of the Treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. And you know, there are many people who are critical of me because they say Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs, even though he must've benefited from them. This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able bodied people. And we're not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, there, there, you poor little thing, we're going to take care of all you needs; you don't have to worry about anything. You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists. And their programs always end up looking the same. They want to take care of people from cradle to grave. But, they want to be involved in every aspect of their lives. And they want most of their earnings. But, they say it'll be a utopia and nobody will have to worry. The problem is all of those societies end up looking the same, with a small group of elites at the top controlling everything, a rapidly diminishing middle class, and a vastly expanded dependent class. That was not the intention for this country. This country was envisioned by individuals who wanted everything to be surrounding the people. Of, for, and by the people. Not, of, for, and by the government. And the government was to respond to the will of the people, not the people to the will of the government. We've allowed the whole thing to be turned upside down. And I'm not an antigovernment person by any stretch of the imagination. I think the government, as described in our Constitution, is wonderful. But, now we've gone far beyond what our Constitution describes, and we've begun to just allow it to expand based on what the political class wants, because they like to increase their power and their dominion over the people, and I think it's time for the people to rise up and take the government back. Now, the political class won't like me saying stuff like that. I'll tell you a secret. The political class comes from both parties and it comes from all over the place, okay. And It includes, unfortunately, even the media now. You know, the media, the press, is the only business in America that is protected by our Constitution. You have to ask yourself a question. Why were they the only ones protected? It was because our founders envisioned a press that was on the side of the people, not a press that was on the side of the Democrats or the Republicans or the Federalists or the Anti-Federalists. And this is a direct appeal to media. You guys have an almost sacred position in a true democracy. Please don't abuse it. You know, my mother's dream was for us to move back to Detroit and we eventually were able to do that, but I was a terrible student and my brother was a terrible student, and she didn't know what to do. So she prayed. She asked God for wisdom. And you know what? You don't have to have a PhD to talk to God. You just have to have faith. And God gave her the wisdom. At least in her opinion. My brother and I didn't think it was that wise. Turning off the TV and making us read books and submit to her written book reports which she couldn't read. But you know it didn't matter, because, because it worked. That was the key. As I started reading those books, which I really didn't want to and I started reading about people of accomplishment, I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens in your life is you. It's not somebody else. And you don't have to be dependent on the good graces of somebody else. You can do it on your own if you have a normal brain and you're willing to work and you're willing to have that can do attitude. You've got to remember it was the can do attitude that allowed this nation to rise so quickly. Because we had people who didn't stop when there was an obstacle. That's how those early settlers were able to move from one sea to the other sea across a rugged and hostile terrain. They knew how to do things. And there were many communities that were separated from other communities by hundreds of miles, but they thrived. Why did they thrive? Because people were willing to work together, to work with each other. If a farmer got injured, everybody else harvested his crops. If somebody got killed, everybody else pitched in to take care of their families. That's who we are. We, Americans, we take care of each other. That's why we're called the United States of America. And what we have done is we've allowed the purveyors of division to become rampant in our society and to create friction and fear in our society. People are afraid to stand up for what they believe in because they don't want to be called a name. They don't want an IRS audit. They don't want their jobs messed with or their families messed with. But isn't it time for us to think about the people who came before us? And what they were willing to do, so that we could be free. Nathan Hale, a teenage rebel, caught by the British, ready to be executed, he said my only regret is that I have but one life to give for my country. A couple of nights ago, I was in Mobile, Alabama, and there were several World War II veterans there in uniform. And I took pictures with all of them. And they were thanking me for being courageous enough to do what I'm doing now. But I said, no, it's you who we must thank. We think about all of those brave men and women who sacrificed life and limb over the years so that we could be free. And we dare not soil their efforts by being timid now and not standing up for what we believe. You have to recognize that one of the rules oin Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, is you make the majority believe that what they believe is no longer relevant and no intelligent person thinks that way and the way you believe is the only way intelligent people believe. And that way they'll keep silent. Because I'll tell you something. They don't care if you don't believe what they believe, as long as you keep your mouth shut. And that's what we have to start doing. We have to start opening our mouths for the values and principles of America. And, I got to tell you something. I'm not politically correct, and I'm probably never going to be politically correct because I'm not a politician. I don't want to be a politician, because, politicians do what is politically expedient, and I want to do what is right. We have to think about that once again in our country. You know, this past couple of weeks, there's been a great deal of turmoil in Baltimore, where I spent 36 years of my life. And we see the turmoil in our cities all over our nation. We need to start thinking about how do we get to the bottom of this issue? You see, I believe that the real issue here is that people are losing hope and they don't feel that life is going to be good for them no matter what happens. So when an opportunity comes to loot, to riot, to get mine, they take it, not believing that there is a much better way to get the things that they desire. Now, interestingly enough, many of these people buy hook, line, and sinker, the idea that our economy is getting much better and that you know the unemployment rate is down to 5%. You know what? If the unemployment rate was down to 5%, our economy would be humming, okay. But obviously, it's not. And it's one of the reasons that our founders said that our freedom and our way of life is dependent upon a well informed and educated populace. Because, what you have to know is that you can make the unemployment rate anything you want it to be based on what numbers you include and what numbers you exclude. So you have to look at the labor force participation rate, which is the number of people eligible to work who are actually working. That number has been steadily going down since 2009 and is now at a 37 year low. Unless you understand those kinds of things, it's eminently possible for slick politicians and biased media to convince you that everything is wonderful when your eyes tell you something different. And I'm saying to people around this nation right now, stop being loyal to a party or to a man and use your brain to think for yourself. That is really the key to us as a nation becoming successful again. Not allowing ourselves to be manipulated by people who think that they are the kingmakers, who think that they are the rulers of thought. They are not the rulers of thought. We, the people are the rulers of thought in this nation. We get to determine what kind of nation we have; other people cannot dictate that for us. We never allow anybody to take that right away from us. And do that when we submit to silliness. You know for instance the majority of Americans were opposed to the so called "Affordable Care Act," and they just rammed it down our throats and say that this is the way it's going to be and if you don't like it, too bad. That was never supposed to be the way that this country was designed. And if we accept it, it will continue that way and it will get worse. And we have to get the right people in place. We need, not only to take the executive branch in 2016, and when I say we, I'm not talking Republicans, I'm talking about anybody who has common sense, you know. We have to have another wave election and bring in people with common sense, who actually love our nation and are willing to work for our nation and are more concerned about the next generation than the next election. That's what's going to help us. We also are going to have to concentrate on fixing the broken economy. Eightteen plus trillion dollars in national debt. And we have representatives who applaud themselves if the deficit doesn't go up as much this quarter as it did last quarter. You know they are completely out to lunch. We have got to drive that thing back down. It's crazy. But it's our responsibility. You need to know who your representatives are. And you need to know how they voted, not how they said they voted. And if they voted to keep raising that debt ceiling, to keep compromising the future of our children and our grandchildren, you need to throw them out of office. $18 trillion dollars. Think about what that means. If you tried to pay that back in a rate of $10 million a day, it would take you over five thousand years. And we're putting that on the backs of people coming behind us. This will be the first year that the national debt exceeds the GDP. Economists will tell you that when the debt to GDP ratio reaches 90%, at that point economic slowdown is inevitable. And you know we've been doing this for a while now. From 1850 to 2000, our economy grew at a rate of 3% at least, even during wars. From 2001 until 2014, it grew at a rate of 1%. That seems to be the new norm. And you probably saw the headlines recently in the last quarter. it grew at like 0%. This is not good. I don't care how anybody tries to spin it. And this is what happens when you have a GDP to debt ratio of 103, which is what we have now. This is what we have got to fix; we've got to fix that immediately because we cannot continue along that pathway. It will have dire consequences in the long run. And I will be giving an in-depth economic speech in weeks and months to come with a lot of details about things that have to be done. But, we need to fix it; we can't just talk about it. And how do we fix it? Well, recognize that we have the most dynamic economic engine the world has ever known right here in America, and we need to use it again. We can't work it when we wrap it in chains and fetters of regulations and new regulations that come out all the time. It doesn't work, it doesn't work when you have high taxation rates, which are absurd. We have the highest corporate tax rates in the world. And yet we sit there or at least some of our officials and they wonder why people do work overseas. Well they obviously don't understand business. People don't go into business to support the government; they go into business to make money. So we have to obviously, we obviously have to create an environment that is conducive to them making money. And you know that means lowering that corporate tax rate, making it competitive and if we were really smart, we would do another big stimulus. You're saying what? What did he just say? Well, remember that big billion dollar stimulus that we were supposed to have at the beginning of the Obama administration? Whatever happened to that? But, but I know where we could get a really big stimulus. There's $2 trillion dollars of offshore money because they won't bring it back because it will be taxed at 35%. What if we give them a tax holiday and let them bring it back, repatriate that money? It won't cost us a dime. That's the kind of thing we have to start thinking about. Think about, you know if you go to the financial advisor and you know you're in trouble, they'll tell you, they'll ask you four questions. What do you own and what do you owe? Well, we owe a lot. It's not just the $18 trillion; it's the $211 trillion in unfunded mandates as well. But, what do we own? We own a lot, also. I mean, just in terms of land and the mineral rights for it, are probably at least $50 trillion. We own dams. We own levees. We own railroads. The government owns 900000 buildings, 77000 of which are being not utilized or underutilized. Think about that. And at the same time, the government is leasing over 500 million square feet from the private sector, using your taxpayer money. It is totally horrendous when you look under the hood, you just want to shut it back down. I mean it is that bad. But, I want to tell you what we're going to do if God ordains that we end up in the White House. I'm going tell you what we are going to do. We are going to change the government into something that looks more like a well run business than a behemoth of inefficiency. And when I say we, I am talking about our team. When I started this endeavor, I am familiar with a man who has started over 30 companies, is extraordinarily successful. And I asked him to put together the rest of the team in order to be able to do this. His name is Terry Giles. Terry, where are you? Right there. Now that we are transitioning from, you know, an exploratory committee, I've asked Terry if he would take the lead in helping to select the people who will be able, who have had enormous experience with business and with making things work, so that we can transition our government from this inefficient thing that we have into something that really works and something that works the way it's supposed to, according to our Constitution. We also have a great team. We have our, let's see, who do we have? We have our chairman, which is Barry Bennett, who never wears a tie but you'll get used to seeing him, and he does a terrific job. And, we have our director of communications, Doug Watts, who does wear a tie. And we have our treasurer and finance director, Logan Delaney. And we have our national spokesperson, Deana Bass. And we're going to be doing different things than you've seen before because it's not political as I've said before. And there are people who say, but you can't do this, you don't have any experience. Let me tell you something. I don't have a lot of experience busting budgets and doing the kinds of things that I've gotten us into all the trouble that we're in now, but I do have a lot of experience in solving problems, complex surgical problems that have never been done by anybody before. I do have experience, I do have corporate board experience with 18 years with Kellogg, and 16 years with Costco, as well as a biotech company. Candy and I do have experience starting a national nonprofit scholars fund. Nine out of 10 of those fail. Ours is thriving in all 50 states and has won several national awards. So, the point being that you can gain experience in other ways. It doesn't have to be just in politics. I can name a lot of people in politics who've been there all their lives and you probably wouldn't want them to polish your shoe. So you know we need to be smart enough to think for ourselves, to listen for ourselves, and in terms of a pedigree that we need, And you know something, I have to tell you, everybody's been telling me, are you ready for this. They're going to come after you with everything under the sun. They're going to look through every record you have; they're going to try to say you are a horrible doctor, you know everything that you can possibly imagine. I know that. That's the way they are. I expect that. It's ok. Don't worry, just listen to what's being said. I'm not even asking everybody to vote for me. I'm just asking people to listen to what I'm saying and listen to what politicians are saying and make an intelligent decision based on your intellect. Because the real pedigree that we need to help to heal this country, to revive this country. Someone who believes in our Constitution and is willing to put it on the top shelf. Someone who believes in their fellow man and loves this nation and is compassionate. Somebody who believes in what we have learned since we were in kindergarten. And that is, that we are one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America. Thank you so much. Well, Candy and I are absolutely delighted to be here, Candy's out there somewhere. You know I always feel so welcome when I come to Iowa, because there are so many people here who actually have common sense, and that is not something that is ubiquitous throughout our land. But you know there's a lot of things that I could talk about in my 20 minutes. Obviously I'm not going to cover all of them, and somebody's gonna say but you didn't cover, Look 20 minutes is a finite period time, but I do want to talk about education, because education is so incredibly important, and it made the difference in my life. It is the great divide in our country. Anybody who gets a good education can write their own ticket. It doesn't matter what their ethnicity is or what their background is and we have to start emphasizing that concept again, that can do attitude that really helped America to propel itself to the pinnacle so fast. You know I was a terrible student. I was one of those people known as the safety net. No one ever had to worry about getting the lowest mark on a test as long as I was there, you know. I took care of that, you know, and I tried to act like it didn't bother me when they all laughed and called me dummy, but it did. Not enough to make study, but it did bother me. I was still into going home and playing basketball, baseball, football, anything. But you know my mother, who is really the hero in my life, she was one of two dozen children, got married at age 13, and she and my father moved from rural Tennessee to Detroit. He was a factory worker. Some years later she discovered he was a bigamist. She only had third grade education herself. The responsibility of trying to raise two young sons by themselves. But I'll tell you, interesting thing about my mother. She never became a victim; she never felt sorry for herself, and that's a good thing. The problem is she never felt sorry for us either, so. There was never any excuse that we could give it was good enough. She would always say, do you have a brain? And if the answer is yes then you could have thought your way out of it. And you know what, I ask that same question of us today in America. Do we have a brain? Do we have the ability to think logically to solve the multiple problems that we have? You know my mother prayed and asked God to give her wisdom. What could she do? And you know that's the wonderful thing about God; you don't have to have a PhD to talk to him; you just have to have faith. And you know what? He gave it to her. He gave here the wisdom, at least in her opinion; my brother and I didn't think it was wise at all, turning off the TV and making us read books. I mean what kind of wisdom is that. As far as we were concerned it was child abuse. And then we have to submit to her written book reports, two apiece each week, which she could read but we didn't know that. She'd put little check marks, highlights, underlines, and I was not a happy camper, I've got to tell you. But you know you had to do it; back in those days had to do what your parents told you. There was no social psychologist saying let the kid express themselves, you know, and I mean don't you find it interesting today how government tries to insert itself into everything They want to tell you how to take care of your children, what you should feed them, how you should discipline them; everything about them. You know what? I would be happy to accept the advice of the government if they were doing everything perfectly, but it seems they can't even run their own house. How are they going run your house? You know, this is the problem. Well at any rate there I was reading those books, but interestingly as I started reading about people of great accomplishment I began to notice something they all seem to have in common, that vision, and that willingness to work hard. And I began to understand that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you in life is you. It's not somebody else. It's not the environment. And at that point, at that point I stopped listening to the naysayers and people who were saying the system is stacked against you, and these people are against you. I didn't have time for them. I was going use that time instead to look at all the incredible opportunities that existed for a young man in inner city Detroit. And there were a lot of things, but you had to go out and do them; they didn't just fall into your lap. And it made a big difference, and I started reading and within the space of a year and a half, I want from the bottom of the class to the top of the class much to the consternation of all those people who used to laugh and call me dummy. Who were now coming to me and saying Benny, Benny, Benny, how do you work this problem? And I would say, sit at my feet youngster while I instruct you. I was perhaps a little obnoxious, but it sure felt good to say that to those turkeys. But you know you think about human brain and what it is capable of, and we need to start putting more emphasis on that once again. We need to be looking at ways that we educate our populace. We look at all the failed schools in some of our inner cities, and yet in the same inner cities you see private schools and charter schools and home schools where people are doing great and high graduation rates and college matriculation rates. So why in the world aren't we trying to get everybody involved in the things that work and get rid of the things that don't work? Because we have special interest groups, and that is the problem, a big problem with our nation today: special interest groups. And there should only be one special interest group and that is that people in the United States of America, and once we understand that, once we understand that, we can do so much better. You know it was interesting that when Alexis de Tocqueville came to America to study our nation because Europeans were so fascinated as to why we were doing so well, he had this big two volume analysis. At the end he concluded that America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, she will cease to be great. And he was right on target, because as we begin to throw away all of our values, and all of our principles and we forget who we are, we will go from being great to being nothing, and we have to fight that. Now, one of the other issues I want to touch on, immigration. You know we have laws in place. Common sense works great. We already have laws that demonstrate how a person becomes an American citizen. We don't have to relitigate that. If we do we relitigate it, it needs to be done by the proper branch of government, which is Congress. It is not by the president; it is not by the Supreme Court. Do we have an illegal immigration problem? Can we fix it? Of course we can. First of all, you have to realize that that there wouldn't be people coming here if there wasn't a magnet drawing them in here. You have to reverse the polarity of the magnet. You have to get rid of all the things that are drawing them in here. including employment. If you employ a person who is illegal, instead getting a pass from the government you should get a criminal activity on your record because it's a crime. And you have to seal the border. Do we have the ability to seal a border? Of course we do; we just don't have will to seal the border. And I think whoever wins in 2016 I'm pretty sure it's going be a Republican. I think they should make it their goal to seal that border within a year. And you know these are common sense kinds of things. Now where's the compassion you say? There are millions of people here illegally who have to hide in the shadows. I don't think they should have to hide in the shadows. We look to the north of us and we see Canada. They have a very well formulated guest worker program. People get registered appropriately, they come, they work, they pay taxes, they go back home. There's a place nobody has to hide in the shadows. I think we could do something like that, but it has to have some stipulations. We shouldn't offer jobs unless Americans won't take them, number one. And number two, in order to get a guest worker permit you have to apply for it from outside of America. You can't be here, okay, because you shouldn't get an advantage for breaking the law. So you leave. It still allows people tothey can easily go and do that, and they probably have an advantage because they know people who want to employ themthey may have established a good work recordand that person can offer them a job and they can come back in and they can take it and they can pay taxes like everybody else in this country pays taxes. And until we can learn how to think that way we're not going win this argument, but when we do it by the law we integrate compassion, but we do, we use our common sense, that's what will make America work once again. Now what about the waste and the fraud. There's a lot waste and fraud in our country right now. I'll give you an example. Medicaid. We spend 400 billion dollars a year on Medicaid. About a quarter of Americans benefit from Medicaid. Now what does that come outa quarter of a million Americans, about 80 million Americans. Do the math. It comes out to about five thousand dollars per Medicaid recipient. Now you've heard about concierge practices, the boutique practices for people who are well off. They average about two to three thousand dollars a year. That means for the most part we could have boutique practices for these people if we didn't waste so much money. Think about what I'm talking about here, and that's why I'm talking about a revamping of the system, but it is imperative that the Republicans embrace a simple, effective system that puts people and their health care providers in charge the health care, and that in turn brings the health care system into the free market systemthat's what controls price and that's what controls quality. We do not need the government controlling our health care, and that's why, that's why I have been such a vehement opposer of Obamacare. Even if it worked I would oppose it. It doesn't. But even if it did I would oppose it. Why would I oppose it? Because I don't believe in taking the most important thing a person has which is their health, their health care, and putting it in the hands of the government because if they have control of the most important thing you have, it's not long before they have control of your whole life and that fundamentally changes America, and we don't want that. And I'm a big believer in waste not, want not. You know I remember my, my mother, you know she worked two, three jobs at a time, extremely hard, because she didn't want to be on welfare. And she only had a third grade education but she noticed that most people who went on welfare never came off it so she just didn't want to go on it in the first place. So she struggled; she worked hard. Occasionally she accepted some assistance, but for the most part was able to stay off of it because she was creative. She would go to the Good Will and buy a pair of pants that had a big hole in the kneesand this was back when that wasn't fashionableand buy a couple of patches and put them on there, and people would be saying where'd you get those jeans? And you know she would go out, take us to the country on a Sunday, and knock on a farmer's door, can we pick four bushels of your apples, corn, beans, three for you and one for us. They always like that deal. She would bring that?it home, can them. She really could stretch moneyshe understood the value of moneyand in fact I'm certain that if my mother were the Secretary of the Treasury we would not be in a deficit situation right now. But a big part of our problem right now is that the government is just too big and they're wasteful, and they don't care what they do with our money. I remember once I was doing a consulting job for the government some years back and and in terms of my fee they said charge anything you want, anything you want. Doesn't matter. I imagine this goes on all the time and it's problematic. You know, you can go back to 2010 and you take income and everybody who makes $69000 and abovethe middle class and above, $5 trillion. A lot of money. The federal budget that year, $3 trillion. Sixty percent of everything the middle class and above makes just to run the federal government. Who thinks that's fair? I don't see a single hand. That is absolutely absurd. It means the government is much too big. There's one well known politician who said you can't cut one penny or it'll be a disaster. Anybody know who that was? Yeah, Nancy Pelosi. Why I mean. That's crazy. So my suggestion is that we cut down on the size of government by attrition. You know thousands of government employees retire every year. Don't replace them. You do that for about four or five years and all the sudden you've got the government down to a reasonable size and people have real jobs. They're not stumbling over each other doing the same thing. Then they don't have time to stick their big noses in everybody's business. You know. And then this this this national debt, $18 trillion and rising, rising at a rate of $500 million a day. Think about that. That's ridiculous. It is compromising the quality of life for everybody who comes after us, and that's what I'm concerned about. My whole career has been spent trying to preserve life, trying to enhance life of children, and now here I was ready to retire, sit back and relax and enjoy life, and then I look out there and I see this monster called the national debt which is threatening the life and quality of those coming behind us. That's why I can't sit down and watch that happen, and I hope none of us is able to sit down and watch that happen. We are going to have to deal with it through economic development. We grow our way out of it; we'll never cut our way out of it, but that does mean that we need to cut, cut down the size of the government, develop the federal government. We need to use our natural resources. God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources. We're the number one producer of oil now on three percent of the land. What would happen if we open up the land? The federal government has no business owning all this land. This is crazy, you know. And all the natural gas we have, and now we have the ability to liquefy natural gas, which means we can export it. And we have all these archaic energy exportation rules that date back to the seventies. We need update those, and we used to use those energy resources not only to enhance our economic position, to pay down our debt, but also to put Putin back in his little box, you know. But you know what my life has been surrounded, taking care of children and that drives a lot of what I do. You know no one should ever be surprised to know that I am pro life because if I spent so many hours trying to figure out how to save people's lives why would I be in favor of people obliterating people's lives? Why would anybody be in favor of that? And in closing I have to tell you, we today enjoy our freedom because there were those who preceded us who were brave. They were not afraid. We have to have courage once again in this country. We cannot allow the progressives to shut us up through political correctness and through all the things that they do. And if they want to act like third graders and call us names, let them. But the fact of the matter is we have a job to do and we need to realize that freedom is not free. You have to fight for freedom every single day. And the next time you sing our National Anthem and you're looking at that flag and you get to the end of that first stanza and it says the land of the free and the home of the brave, please remember that it is impossible to be free if you're not brave. Thank you and God Bless. Well, listen, standing here with me, of course, are the people who I've dedicated my life to: My sweet daughters, Emma and Reese Kasich. You know, I remember when they were born, remember that, sweetie? I kept saying to the doctor, How's it going, you know, and he's trying to deliver two, and finally, he looks at me square in the eye, and he said, Can you shut up? I'm a little busy right now. And they came out, and I could hold them in the palm of my hand. It was so sweet. And so I, along with Karen, have dedicated our lives to giving them a better life than we were able to ever get from our parents. And you know what? They're doing fantastic. Emma and Reese Kasich. And my wife, pray for her. She's married to me, OK? From the very tips of my toes to the top of my head, I just love my wife so much. Such a greater partner and such a great lady. So I want to tell you that it's this whole business of the American Dream, isn't it, that we can all work to make sure that next generation is going to be in a position of greater strength than what we received. And I get my inspiration from the people who came before me. And I want to tell you about a few of the ones that inspire me. I'd like to start with my uncle Steve. Uncle Steve was a tough guy, you know, the son of a coal miner. Rough and gruff and tell it like it is. And he found himself at Iwo Jima, and he looked around during that battle and he saw a lot of people dying. Uncle Steve was not a church going man, but in the middle of all the violence and the blood and the death, he said to God, if you will take me off this island, I will go to church every day for the rest of my life. And he did. And he did. And Uncle Steve When Uncle Steve came home from the war, the brothers all slept in the same room; they didn't have a lot. And Uncle George told me that he would have nightmares and he would speak in Japanese. And he told his brothers never wake me, never wake me from that nightmare because I don't what will happen. Let me sleep and wake up on my own. And Uncle George, he's here today, he's right over here. He's 89 years old. I so love my Uncle George. He's the patriarch of our family. Well, Uncle George was in the infantry, and he was scheduled to take a boat from England to Belgium. But the division he was in couldn't all fit in the boat, so they asked Uncle George to wait until the next day. Well that boat left England on its way to Belgium, and a submarine launched a torpedo and sunk that boat and everyone on it perished. The next day, Uncle George took another boat and he landed in France. And he fought with great honor and he returned home and became a guidance counselor and guided young people for the next 38 years of his life. What a man. You know, when my father in law, we call him Popsy, grandfather, joined the Marines at the age of 17; wanted to serve his country. But I guess most important, my mom and dad. You know, Mom was, well, she was a visionary. Didn't get the education; you know, her mother could barely speak English, but boy, was she smart. And if you think I have opinions, you never met my mom. And my father was the mailman. They called him John the Mailman. And when we laid my mother and father to rest, there were countless numbers of people who came and said John the Mailman, he watched out for all of us. And they gave up so much, didn't take, I wished they'd have spent more on themselves, but they just, no matter what you told them, they weren't doing to do it because it was all about the next generation. And they are the ones that have inspired me. And all of you that are here today, you're the same way, aren't you? You've got those people who did so much for you who are your heroes. And they don't have to be famous, they're just people you love and that you admire. That American Dream that is pivotal for the future for our country, but I have to tell you there are a lot of people in America today who are not sure that that American Dream is possible, that that American Dream is alive. And I can understand their concerns. You know, when I was a kid, you went out and you got a job and you worked at that job your entire lifetime. You got your health care, you got your retirement and everything was good. Today, you could be a 51 year old man and one day after serving and doing everything the right way, somebody walks into your office and says, I'm sorry, but we don't need you anymore. Can you imagine that conversation? Could you imagine that dad when he is driving home or that mom when she is driving home? They lose confidence. They wonder what their future is. Can they get another job? Can they support their family? Will anybody be there to help them? Or how about moms and dads today? They send their kids to college, many of these young people ringing up massive amounts of debt trying to get an education and they are living in the attic and Mom and Dad are wondering, will they get a job? Will they pay their bills? What kind of a future are they going to have? Or, at the same time, we can also think about what all of us fear greatly and that is the problems of bad health. Can I afford those expensive drugs that I need to survive? What is it going to cost me to get treatment, just not for myself but for one of the loved ones in my family? Will I be bankrupted and lose everything I have, everything I've worked for? It's a real fear. Or the fear of the tsunami of drugs, it's everywhere, isn't it? The kids that are here and there are many of them, don't do drugs, don't put that big 1000 pound pack on your back and keep you from your God given purpose. But all moms and dads worry that those drugs are going to wash away our own neighborhoods and maybe wash away our children. And how about those that struggle to make ends meet? There are some people just say, oh, well, just work harder or pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I believe in all that. Some people just don't have the fortune that many of us have. And they struggle. They struggle for a whole lifetime and they worry, that can they rise? Can they, can they pull the rest of their family members up the ladder, the promise of America? And they worry about it. Or how about if you are a member of the minority community, an African American? You wonder. The system, I think, sometimes doesn't just work for me but sometimes I feel like that system works against me. And you think about the troubles that many of our African Americans still face today in a world where we have worked to provide equal rights and opportunities. Sometimes they are not so sure and I don't blame them. Or how about all of us? We pick up the paper. It's Chattanooga, it's Fort Hood, it's ISIS. Are we safe? Are we going to be safe to go to the mall? Are we safe to leave our homes? These are the worries that many Americans have. But I have to tell you, as serious as these are, and they are very serious, we have had a lot worse, much worse in this country. Think about it, the civil war. You remember reading about it? I mean, it's not just neighbors fighting against neighbors, but it was even family members, kin fighting against one another and killing one another on a battlefield right in America. How about the racial violence that we experienced in this country? The early days of television when they put the dogs and the gas and the batons on people of another color. Or the world wars, where many in our families never came home, leaving widows and children without a dad. Or the Depression, the Depression. Ask your grandfather, ask your mom and dad about that depression. My father used to say that he would go down to the store and get some food for the family and the guy would say, We'll put it on your bill. There was no bill. That's what it took for America to get through the Depression. And you all remember that crystal clear morning and the horror we felt on 9/11. But guess what? We've always got through it, because the testing is what makes you stronger. It's the challenges that make you better. I have lived through them, and I have become stronger for them, and America has become stronger for them. And here's how we've done it: by staying together. Not by dividing each other but by staying together with our eyes on the horizon, with our eyes on the horizon, about the future. We have a little town in Ohio called Wilmington. They followed that formula. Let me tell you about these folks. They played by the rules, worked every day, highly productive, teamwork, and one day, an employer said, We're leaving. We're out of here. And thousands of people, thousands of hardworking, God fearing people like your neighbors, went from getting a paycheck on a Friday afternoon to visiting a food pantry so they could feed their kids. I was down there in 2010 after this earthquake, economic earthquake hit Wilmington. We had a campaign bus. My wife was with me. We walked through that food pantry. We looked at the people and preachers and civil servants and leaders and caregivers. They were at the food pantry, but they hadn't lost any hope, because they had their eyes on the horizon. We got back on the bus, I will never forget it as long as I live, we got back on, on the bus, and I said, Folks, do you understand, some of them had been with me for a long time, so they got it. But some of the others were rookies. I said, Do you understand what we are doing here? This isn't a political campaign. And by the way, either will this be. This is not a political campaign. Did you see those people? Did you see the tears in their eyes? Did you see them hugging their children? Did you see them not hopeless? We're going to join in, and we're going to help them, because it is our job and our mission as human beings, as children of God, to work with them, to lift them. And guess what? And guess what? And in Wilmington today, the sun's coming up. I told them that the sun would come up again. It hasn't reached its zenith, but the sun is rising, and the sun is going to rise to the zenith in America again. I promise you, it will happen. Listen, you know, you know, you know who does this? See, it's you and me. See, it's teachers and preachers and moms and dads, doctors, construction workers, like that sweet man in Brown County that saw his family washed away over the weekend, keep him in your prayers, police and firemen and people like my dad, the mailman, John the mailman, because we are the glue, we are the glue that holds our country together. How about, as for me, as for me, look, I'm just trying to do my best, OK? I came here to Ohio State. I found myself on the 19th floor of one of the towers. You could hit it with a stone from here. I had 15 roommates. The place was 23 floors high. The tower next door, the same size. Ohio State can be a pretty intimidating place, OK. It's big. It is a big place. And I left my dorm room, went down to the first floor and I walked just right down the path to Ohio Stadium. And it was a time when you could actually walk in that stadium, they didn't have that one end closed in. And I walked into that stadium, I swear this happened, and I walked right to the 50 yard line. There was no one in the stadium that day, and I looked around. All of those seats, those big structures that were there and I thought to myself either this place is going to take me down or I'm going to take it down. One way or the other, it was going to be, you know, either it was going to be me or it was going to be a place, kids, because you'll face it someday, to help me move forward. You know, it's amazing, I'm back here today. You could throw a stone and hit that stadium or you could hit that dormitory so many years later, and guess what? I am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support, for your efforts because I have decided to run for president of the United States. You know, they, they ask you all the time like it's a trick question or something, you know, well why do you want to do this. I mean, it's like they're going to catch you, right? I mean, I mean, if you can't answer that question, you ought to be back at the 50 yard line at Ohio Stadium wondering about your future. I do this because, well, first of all, we're not born to serve others. Think about this, I want you to think about this. If we're not born to serve others, what were we born to do? I do this for my family, of course, for my sweet family, for my neighbors, Molly, for my friends of many, many, many years, many of whom are working with me today 30, 40 years later. I really do it for everyone. And I have to humbly tell you, and I mean humbly tell you, that I believe I do have the skills and I have the experience I have the experience and the testing, the testing which shapes you and prepares you for the most important job in the world. And I believe I know how to work and help restore this great United States. And I have to tell you, it's a daunting challenge. I was just at Wendy's on Saturday up here on Hudson Avenue, and the two wonderful African American fellows were there. And I walked in, I was standing behind them, and one said to the other one, I don't know what I believe what I'm seeing, but I think that's Governor Kasich standing behind me. And he said you better run. Do you know what meant to me? Two African American guys, one with a knee, a brace on his knee and another one with a cane. And I said well, you know, people are going to have a lot more money than I am, and they looked at me and they said but you've got statistics, you've got statistics. So some are going to ask, as they always have, why do you think you can do this. You know, all of my life, people have told me you can't do something, OK? And I'll tell you why. It's because I do believe in the power of very big idea, big bold ideas. In 1976, I went out to the convention in Kansas City and not only worked for Ronald Reagan, but I worked with Ronald Reagan and I got to travel with Ronald Reagan. Yes, I actually knew the guy, OK, the real guy, not from the history book. He lost at that convention. I had been managing, I think, five states for him at that convention. I mean, you talk about lightning striking me. I was 24 years old. I walked in; they were one man short and said, could you manage five states for the governor? I had no idea what they were saying. I said, of course I could. OK? I had no idea about it. Well, he lost, as you know. And I was there when he met with his closest advisers. And he said we've lost the battle. We hadn't lost any war because we will all be back. And I'm going to fix America with all of your help. And of course, he did and it further cemented my notion that big ideas, big ideas change the world. Big ideas change the world. So I came back, I came back here to Ohio and I was all charged up and I was working as an aide. And I came back and I remember meeting with one of my buddies. And I said, you know, I think I'm going to just run for the state senate and beat that guy we had been watching. And I remember he was drinking something and it fell on the floor when I told him that. People, look, I was 24 years old. I had no relatives that lived in the state. I didn't really know anybody, but I had a big idea. And you know what we did? We went out and we got moms and dads, a lot of moms who went door to door and rang doorbells. And the weekend before the election one of the local newspapers said, he is a fine young man but he has no chance to win. Well, I won that election with the help of the army of volunteers. I went on to chair the health committee, where I learned to work across the aisle because the House was run by Democrats and that is where I learned that policy is far more important than politics, ideology or any of the other nonsense we see. You know, they said it couldn't be done. We proved them wrong. And then at the ripe old age of 30 I decided I'm going to run for Congress. My mother and father are like, Johnny, what are you doing now? OK? Well, they said I couldn't win. I was too young. And by the way, I was, I was going to run against an incumbent in 1982; it's like the worst year. We lost 26 Republican seats that year. I was going to run against a guy, a guy who got one of his degrees from Harvard. That's when I knew I had an edge. Clearly he couldn't have gotten into Ohio State. And I knew I had an edge. And in 1982 I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat all across this country. And guess what? Here is the irony. I got to go to Washington and work with President Ronald Reagan. You know? They said, they said it couldn't be done and we proved them wrong again. And then I got down to Washington and got on a, the Armed Services Committee, where I served for 18 years on national security. And I was there just the blink of an eye and I discovered that these hammers and screwdrivers had cost thousands of dollars. And it was taking the resources from the people that needed it who were serving in the military. We were wasting money. And I said we need to clean this up. And they're like, No, come on. It's the Pentagon. You can't, you, forget about it. It can't happen. Well, we passed some legislation and we made things right. We saved money. We improved the system. And we helped the military. They said it couldn't be done and we proved them wrong again. Let me be clear. Our military must be improved. We need to, we need to We need to cut the bureaucracy, and we need to strengthen our services. Now, I'm a person, I'm person that doesn't like to spend a lot of money. But in this case, national security climbs to the very top of the heap, because we must be strong, and we must assume our role as leaders of the world. So six years after I got to Congress, I got on the budget committee. And I remember going to those first few meetings, Bob. I mean, it was, like, terrible, and I was complaining. I was up right here at a gas station in Westerville, and I'm saying, These people don't want to do anything. And some guy walked around the pump, and he looked me square in the eye. He said, Things are so bad, what are you going to do about them? So I flew down to Washington, I met with my staff, about six of them, and I said, You know, I think, I think we should just write a budget for the United States of America. And they said, Well, there's, like, 100 people at the White House working on a budget and probably 50 up here, and we only have six. And I said, I know, we're overstaffed, but we stay out of our way, we'll be able to get this done. And we wrote a budget for the United States of America. And why? Everybody knows me as a budget guy. It's not about numbers; it's about vision, it's about values, and we do not have the right as grownups to ring up debts to suit ourselves and pass them onto the next generation. We don't have that right. 10 years of my life I worked at this. My first budget was 405 to 30. I had the 30. My staff was depressed. I thought we were doing pretty well. That's how I was. Well, we just kept at it and kept at it and kept at it. And you heard my great friend, John Sununu, by the way, one of the smart, he's a wonderful, wonderful man. If John Sununu had not come to me and told me he was going to help me in New Hampshire, I wouldn't have done this. I, I've just got to tell you. He is remarkable, and we did it together. And the politicians didn't care about, they, they didn't care about anything, about being reelected; they cared about fixing America, Pat. They cared about getting the budget balanced and getting the economy going. You know what? They said it couldn't be done. They said it was too big, too hard, too much politics, and we proved them wrong again, and we balanced that federal budget. We balanced it. You want job creation, you balance the books. Am I right? You balance the books. And if I'm president, or maybe I should say when I am president I will promise you, I will promise you that my top priority will get this country on a path to fiscal independence, strength, and we will rebuild the economy of this country, because creating jobs is our highest moral purpose, and we will move to get that done. And by the way, by the way, how about a little balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so Congress will start doing its job? So I left. You know, I, I, I left Washington and had a great time. You, you know, I was, worked at Lehman Brothers and learned about businesses, and I went to Fox News, where, as you know, I was a giant television star. And I had a great time. But you know, I, I had a calling. It was like, here's kind of how it went. Didn't hear anything, but it was clear to me. You've had an amazing life. You got a lot of skills. You're going back. You're going back. And I sensed it when I was on a trip and I came back and called my friends together and said, I guess we got to do this, and they, you know, a lot of people, the doubters, they said, Well, you know, you haven't been in politics for 10 years, in a decade. You have never run state wide, and we haven't defeated an incumbent in 36 years in Ohio. Incumbents don't lose. So we put together a vision, we put together a team. They said it couldn't be done and we proved them wrong again. And then we took over the reins. But, you know, we didn't go unprepared. We knew what we wanted to do, because I'm going to tell you, if I'm president, I know what we need to do, OK? There's no confusion about that. I know what needs to be done. I have been there at all levels, OK. When we came in here, $8 billion in the hole, a loss of 350000 jobs, $0 in the rainy day fund. One guy said that he game them a dollar just to double the rainy day fund. A lot of hopelessness here, particularly among the poor and minorities. People said maybe Ohio's best days are behind them. I thought that was just a bunch of baloney. And I said not only will we get this budget balanced, but we'll cut taxes, and they were like, are you kidding me? There's no way we can do that. So we went to work. And we didn't have to slash, we didn't have to really slash things, we just had to use a 21st century formula. Improve things, innovate them, make a better product at a lower price. You know, let Mom and Dad stay in their home rather than being forced in a nursing home, let them stay in their own home where they'll be healthier and happier. And if we have to knock down the special interests to get it done, so be it. And that's what we did. Now today, four and a-half years later, $8 billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus. A loss of 350000 jobs, a gain of 350000 jobs. And tax cuts, tax cuts of $5 billion, the largest in the country. And as I hope you all know, economic growth is not an end unto itself. If you're drug addicted, we're going to try to rehab you and get you on your feet. If you're mentally ill, prison is no place for you. Some treatment and some help is where you need to be. If you're the working poor, we're going to give you an opportunity to take a pay raise and not bang you over the head because you're trying to get ahead. Well, we're changing that system. If you have an autistic son or daughter, for most of them, they can get insurance, and we'll work to make sure all of them have it. For the developmentally disabled, they're made in God's image. They have a right to rise, they have to be successful. And with all this, with all this, they said it couldn't be done. And guess what? We proved them wrong again. And I'm going to take what we've learned here in the heartland, that band of brothers and sisters that I work with every day, and we are going to take the lessons of the heartland and straighten out Washington, DC and fix our country. Well, and you know, now they're going to say, got a lot of them back here, they're going to say well, you know, nice guy or good guy or whatever they, or not a good guy, whatever they're going to say, OK. I don't know if he can win. But with you, and you, sweetheart, OK; can you paint signs? And with, and with all of you, together, we'll prove them wrong again, won't we? We'll prove them wrong again. Thank you. So our team, you know, we'll tame the bureaucracy, we'll restore some common sense. Mary Taylor has the Common Sense Initiative; get rid of all those stupid rules. Well, we'll do that in Washington. How about putting some people in the government that understand job creators and respect them rather than beating them down? How, how about that for an idea? How about some common sense and make America stronger militarily? But folks, here's the thing that I want to say to you, and I said this at my inaugural. Some people think they just don't matter in this. Do you know how wrong that is? You know, we got this Holocaust Memorial, and there's a line etched that says, If you save one life, you've changed the world. Do you believe that? Do you believe that? If you save one life, you changed the world. And the Lord will record what you've done for another in the Book of Life. Now, we've got some values that we need to think about that can bring us together. Because folks, we're a divided country, but we can fix it. I'll tell you what I think some of them are: personal responsibility. God ate, or, The dog ate my homework, went out in the fifth grade, OK? Here's the thing. We own our lives. I mean, if you're hurting, we'll help you. You know, my mother used to say, my mother used to say that it is a sin not to help somebody who needs help but it's equally a sin to continue to help somebody who needs to learn how to help themselves. Personal responsibility needs to be restored in our country. Teach our children. Resilience. Everybody doesn't get a trophy just for showing up, folks. You know what resilience is? It's getting knocked down, and I have been knocked down so many times. But getting knocked down's not the problem. It's refusing to get up. We need to teach our kids, teach our children about resilience and remind ourselves that you're 51 years old, and you lost your job. You're going to come back stronger and better, and we'll help you. Empathy, this one is so important. I just would ask you to think. Put yourself in the shoes of another person. We're so quick to make judgments today in our country. Don't walk so, so, so fast. You know, yesterday, I was coming downtown, and, and there was a lady, and she was older, and she had a cane, and she was barely walking. She was putting one foot in front of another. I wanted to stop and just hug her, encourage her. People who have not been dealt, dealt the best hand in life, yeah, we want to hold them accountable, but the Lord wants our hearts to reach out to those that don't have what we have. I mean, that shouldn't be hard for America. That's who we are. When people have studied our country, they have talked about our compassion, and we need to bring it back. Empathy, don't be so quick to judge. Me, too, OK? Me, too. And then teamwork. I know Tom Moe is up here. You know, one time, he, you know, he used to run the veterans. I call it the great arc of life. The man goes in the military, he sits in the Hanoi Hilton, beaten all the time in a tiny little cell, he comes home, and I put him in charge of the veterans. I mean, this was the arc, the beautiful arc of what's right. Tom had a little code. I don't know where he is right now. Here he is right here. He tapped out a code that kept them all together, and it was team that carried them through the most difficult times. Uncle George, it was team that helped you to be successful, wasn't it? The Vietnam veterans and Iraqi veterans and the Afghanistan veterans, we do best. Or the Depression, when we all hung together. Teamwork, team, they're not the enemy; they're part of our team. We can disagree. They're our team. And then family, huh? Look at these families here. It's the building block of America. It's the building block of our culture. Let's recognize it. And of course, faith. And faith is real simple for me. It's about the dos, not about the don'ts. And what it's really about is God didn't put us on this Earth just to take of ourselves, He put us on this Earth to make things a little bit better because we live here. And so there are some that are going to try to divide us; we see about it all the time. You know forget it. I don't pay any attention to that kind of nonsense. At the end of the day, it's about being together. Because, you know, it says We the People. And by the way, if you think that I or anybody who becomes president or a big shot, we don't, we don't move America. Oh, we do our part if we have courage and intelligence, but it's all of us in the neighborhoods, in the families across the country. We're the strength and the glue. Don't, please, please, please don't lose sight of it. As for me, I'm just a flawed man, a flawed man trying to honor God's blessings in my life. I just, I don't even understand it. He's been very good to me. And I want you to know that I will do my very best to serve you because you are in my mind's eye. Who are you? Get up every day, go to work, work hard, follow the rules, come home, spend time with your family and at night, you go to bed and say your prayers for your family, for your neighbors and for our nation. And folks, as it has been said many times, the light of a city on a hill cannot be hidden. The light of a city on a hill cannot be hidden. America is that city and you are that light. As we have seen earlier this evening, the roots of the Republican Party lie in the belief in the power and dignity of the individual. We believe that America should be run from the bottom up, not the top down. We believe that true greatness comes from everyday American heroes, from Lance Armstrong who overcame cancer and pedaled his way into the hearts of all Americans to Albert Lexie, an ordinary shoeshine man who donated over $40000 in tip money to a children's hospital. We believe America works best when it is run from our families and our communities to the top. Nothing better illustrates those Republican principles than George W. Bush's economic program. First and foremost, we believe in tax cuts. For me, tax cuts are more than just numbers; they are a real moral issue. Every time we cut taxes we make government less important and people across the country more important. Tax cuts give us the power and the resources to fix the problems we face everyday in our own families and within our communities. Today in America, the government taxes people more just because they are married. This is wrong and we will end it. People work a lifetime to build a business or a family farm. Then the government takes it away when they die. This death tax is wrong and we will end it. Our senior citizens are punished for working longer and contributing more to our nation. This policy makes no sense and we will end it. George W. Bush has demonstrated real courage and real leadership for standing up to the Washington elite. He has proposed a bold plan to save and strengthen Social Security. Everyone in America understands the power of the economy. Everyone in America knows that investing in this economy will help save social security. The Liberal elite does not trust us to build our own retirement. But you and I know that through voluntary personal retirement accounts we can create wealth and personal security for ourselves and our families in our most important years. This is yet another example of our bottom up philosophy. And finally, nothing represents the power of the individual more than the opportunities of the Internet and the New Economy. It's the Internet and the New Economy that have unleashed individual creativity and potential. It has created more wealth, more broadly for more people than any era in human history. We are going to live longer, we are going to communicate faster, and we are going to work smarter. But most important, we are going to lift our economy to brand new heights. The only thing that can stand in the way of this remarkable progress is intrusive government. And we will not let it happen. Tax cuts, saving and strengthening Social Security, expanding our New Economy, and running America from the bottom up. This is the excitement of the 21st Century. This is our program. This is our vision. But America's greatest assets can only be realized if we protect the principle of opportunity for every single American. My parents taught me that through hard work and education, you could achieve anything. Our bottom up approach will guarantee this opportunity. My parents also told me to care for and help others. By doing this we will improve the lives of the next generation represented by my 6 month old daughters, Emma and Reese. This is the American Dream. This is what George W. Bush is all about. last Friday in Paris it was made obvious to the world yet again that there is an enormous chasm between the worldview of civilized people and the worldview of those who committed these acts of horror. We believe that life has value and meaning. They see no value even in their own lives, let alone others. We believe that different views and ideas should be respected and these make us stronger. They believe the answer to disagreement is death. We believe men and women are equal. They believe women are property. We live in the light of God's love for all creation. They pervert and hijack one of the world's principle religions. We live in the modern world, a world of free expression, a world of science, of respect for individual rights and liberties. They live in a darkness, devoid of even the basic understanding of humanity. We forget these differences, it's at our peril. Unless we want to see the bloodshed of Paris visited here in America and in the streets of our allies' capitols we need to get serious immediately about dealing with this threat. There can be no negotiating and no delay with this darkness. We must simply defeat it. We cannot wait on a resolution to the Syrian crisis to begin dealing with ISIS. I'm not convinced that the agreement achieved in Vienna several days ago on the future of Syria will be implemented on the announced schedule or, frankly, any schedule. And I doubt it will lead to any certainty over serious future leadership. A ceasefire is supposed to occur within six months and elections within 18, paving the way for a potential political transition in Syria. I believe these are empty promises. What is more, with ISIS having directly threatened the US homeland we can't afford to wait, we must act now. We must invoke Article Five, the Mutual Defense Clause of the North American Treaty and bring NATO together to assist our ally France in its defense. I agree with President Hollande that Friday's attacks were an act of war by ISIS on France and therefore they were an attack on America and every other NATO member state. NATO came to our aid after 9/11. NATO must now do so again for France. We must be swift. We must be decisive. And we must be absolute. We must intensify international intelligence cooperation by identifying, exchanging information on tracking, and if necessary arresting the thousands of foreign volunteers currently fighting with ISIS who then later return to their home countries. End to end communications encryption technology is increasingly leaving our intelligence agencies in the dark. We must develop new signals intelligence methods to illuminate these targets technologically, and of course we must also invest more in human intelligence assets with which to penetrate and neutralize these terrorist groups. Our signals intelligence and human intelligence, they do not exist separate from one another. They accent and complement one another and every effort should be made to leverage each for the other's benefit. We also need to reassess our domestic counterterrorism resources to ensure that our joint FBI/CIA counterterrorism taskforces have the personnel they need to track potential domestic terrorists. We must provide far more support to the Kurds both in Syria and Iraq. The Kurds who are fighting to defend their homeland fight like tigers and they are one of the few groups friendly to the United States who really have shown that they know how to take the fight to ISIS. We must arm them much more, much more generously than we have done so far. Turkey has legitimate concerns about arming the Kurdish YPK in Syria. We must work to address their concerns as we assist on addressing a threat to the vital national interests of America and the rest of the world. We must create safe havens protected by No Fly Zones. I first called for No Fly Zones early last month in order to relieve the suffering of Syrian refugees and reduce their need to travel to Europe. These sanctuaries should be located on the Turkish and on the Jordanian borders. Our Jordanian and Kurdish allies should provide protection for them on the ground while the United States provides protection from the air. We must arrest human traffickers, prosecute them, put them in jail, and confiscate their ill gotten gains. We must create an international coalition to defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. We must join with our NATO allies and importantly with allies in the region as well. That would be the Turks, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Gulf states, the Saudis to organize an international coalition to defeat ISIS on the ground in its heartland. Experience of course has shown that an air campaign on its own is not enough. We must be more forceful in the battle of ideas. US public diplomacy and international broadcasting have lost their focus on the case for Western values and ideals and effectively countering our opponents' propaganda and disinformation. I will consolidate them into a new agency that has a clear mandate, to promote the core Judeo Christian Western values that we and our friends and allies share, the values of human rights, the values of Democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association. And it should focus on four critical targets, the Middle East, China, Iran, and Russia. Sophisticated strategies will be developed to communicate with each of these hard target countries. The challenge posed by ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a symptom of a broader weakness in America's national security policy. Failing to advance our values in the battle of ideas, not doing so against a threat such as ISIS or in places such as Syria and Iraq is interpreted by other opponents around the world as weakness. The administration's desire for an Iran nuclear deal at any cost is another example, and weakness invites challenges and attacks of the kind that we have seen from nations that do not share our values such as China and Russia. By invading Georgia, annexing Crimea, fomenting a murderous proxy war in Eastern Ukraine, mounting provocative patrols, and building out its base structure in both Kaliningrad and Belarus, Russia has once again become a threat to European security. Russia's leadership today does not respect the basic tenets of international order, namely territorial integrity and the rule of law. Those are basic values of international relations and Russia's failure to respect them is simply not compatible with constructive relations with the West. We must work together with our European allies to defend a free Ukraine. That includes training and arming Ukrainian forces with the weapons that they have asked for and which Congress has already approved. It also means focusing on the defense of new NATO member states on the front lines with Russia, such as Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. NATO must be vigilant and protective of its easternmost member states who live every day in Russia's shadow. We must focus on supplying and equipping them in achieving interoperability, jointly committing to higher defense spending targets, repositioning existing US forces in Europe onto their eastern borders, increasing cooperation with Finland and Sweden and building a new strong integrated air defense system on NATO's eastern border. We must also learn the lessons of Crimea and develop and exercise contingency plans for dealing with future Russian provocations. You know, there are no such things as little green men or volunteers. Any such combatants will be treated as what they are, an attacking Russian army. If they reappear I will take US forces in Europe and around the world to heighten combat readiness in order to be able to intervene in support of our friends and our allies. While Russia's actions are forcing us to take tough measures to achieve peace through strength and safeguard our friends and our allies, I will make it clear that the door to negotiations remains open. I am confident that by sitting and talking together with our allies, Russia and America, that we can forge a new European security architecture that accommodates their interests without damaging those of NATO member states. The same is true for our relationship with China. The weakness we have shown toward Russia is really no different than that we have shown towards China. Its efforts to control the South China Sea and seabed resources to which it is not entitled are blatant violations of international rules and norms. These are boldfaced efforts to do nothing more than bully its neighbors. Because of those efforts, we must now stand by our Western Pacific allies who rightfully feel threatened by China's belligerence. That means working with our regional allies to significantly increase our military presence in the region, to ensure freedom of navigation for the 5 trillion in annual trade that passes through the Western Pacific. We must forward deploy our Pacific Combat Commander to Guam in stationing additional Air Force and Marine Corps units in the Western Pacific. We should increase joint Western Pacific freedom of navigation and submarine patrols. We should conduct regular regional amphibious landing exercises. We should help our Japanese allies defend their territorial waters by installing seabed acoustic sensor systems, anti-ship missiles, rocket launch torpedoes, and mine laying equipment through their southern island chain. To deal with the nuclear threat posed by North Korea I will work with South Korea and our other regional allies to revitalize allies' counter proliferation activities and to build ballistic missile defenses. The US does not seek confrontation with China. We should remain open to working responsibly with our allies and with China as an equal stakeholder. Together we should be able to forge innovative solutions and institutions that respect and accommodate the national security interests of all Pacific powers. The same mistakes in judgement and strategy that have let terrorism flourish in recent years and wrongly signal weakness to Russia and China are found throughout American national security policy right now, and it all comes down to this: We have not led, because leadership has not been a priority we have been content to let the tools of leadership are military and our alliance relations grow weak and frayed. We have even hesitated to express and live by the values at the core of who we are. It's time for change before it's too late. We must rebuild our nation's sorely neglected military from the bottom up. This doesn't mean that like some we rush to fund every General's wish list. Instead we must assess our combined allied capabilities and identify the needs and gaps in dealing with threats that we face in each region of the world. This means being strategic about rebuilding our military, matching it to the threats that we face and complementing the capabilities of our allies. We must also be more careful in how we spend our military dollars, especially on weapons systems. We can make our dollars go further and get our troops the equipment they need faster by rewarding on target cost estimates, insisting on extensive prototyping, incentivizing contractors and program managers to be ahead of schedule and under budget, using off the shelf technology as much as we can, and putting in place high threshold criteria for design changes. Likewise, we must ensure that scarce resources reach those who need them most, and those would be our fighting men and women. By streamlining the Pentagon bureaucracy, defining performance standards, and holding our defense civilian workforce to them, providing greater flexibility both to hire the talent we need and part company with consistent underperformers. And we must recognize that cyberspace is a battlefield as well that demands our attention and resources. This has not been the federal government's strength and we must not shy away from turning to the private sector for much needed help to protect ourselves and to take the battle to the enemy. We can and we must take out of the resources that our enemies use to wage war online. Not only do we need strong, decisive, multilateral agreements to respond to anyone that attacks our governments and our private sector and our allies but we need an aggressive strategy to go after the cyber resources of our enemies. Not only does this eliminate threats, but of course it also deters future attacks. We have let ourselves fall too far behind in this arena. Rebuilding our military is no easy task. We know it will be expensive, and it cannot be done without first making sure that we have a strong economy. No one understood this as well as President Ronald Reagan. I have proposed an economic revival plan that will provide the growth we need to be strong, strong economically but also strong militarily. Importantly, we need to balance our budget and we need to stop adding to our national debt. What leverage do we have in dealing with other nations if they are the ones loaning us money for our out of control spending? Relationships with our allies are critical to all we must do going forward. Friends like those in Europe have been ignored. Friends like Israel have been abused. We need to repair the damage. There is strength in numbers, strength in consensus, and by acting in concert with our allies by sharing intelligence, by working together in international bodies we can more effectively advance our interests and we can keep Americans safe. As we rebuild our military we should consult with our allies to assess their military needs and their strengths, and of course we also should expect them to pull their weight. And nothing about being an ally means you will not advance your own interests. An exclusive diet of going it alone, that's unsustainable, but America must always reserve the right to take its own actions and lead. Our allied relationships are rooted in shared values such as respect for human life, freedom of thought, expression, and religion, equality and the right of every person, every person to have the chance to learn, grow, and achieve. These are handed down to us by our Judeo Christian tradition which has guided our civilization for centuries, yet it is fair to say that at times we seem to have forgotten them or have become afraid to stand up and proclaim them. If we don't know what we believe how do we know what we want from life? How do we set goals for our families, our communities, or our nations? If we let ourselves begin to drift, so afraid to offend anyone that we're afraid even to say what we think is right, we put our futures in peril. In this vacuum of values is it any wonder that we see bright, educated young people abandoning the West for the meaning they think they see in the extremist cause? Values are a compass that can help us individually and as a society navigate personal challenges in an increasingly complex and dangerous world. We need to rediscover them. We need to recommit ourselves to them with passion and without apology. This is not our battle alone. We should join with those moderate Muslims who have condemned the attack on Paris and who see through the lie of extremism. We must encourage them and join with them to speak with one voice so that the world's young people understand what is a lie, what is true, what is darkness, and what is light and life. Finally, a word about how I see America's role in the world. There seems to be a fear today to call America exceptional. I believe America is exceptional. It is simply a statement of the obvious. We are exceptional because of our uniqueness. America is not a language or ethnic group or religion. We are the melting pot of every people in the world, so when Paris hurts we hurt, when Ukraine hurts we hurt, and conversely when those places hurt and we don't act the world is weaker and so are we. Throughout all of our history America has never been afraid to fight for our values and ideas. Oh yeah, it's okay that sometimes we argue. That's just part of it. The fact that we have disagreements is part of how we live, but at each moment of crisis we have united as a nation, at each moment we came together in common cause, at each moment we united the civilized world, and of course we came out stronger because of it. This is that moment. It's not someone else's job, nor is it our job alone. It is in the hands of each of us and our allies to realize that we can change the world, we can fix this, we can make America and the world a safer place to ensure that our children and grandchildren can live to fulfill their dreams and ours. Thank you Thank you. Well thank you very much. Candy and I are delighted to be here. And I will just get right into it, because I don't have a whole lot of time. And we're going to want to leave a little time to answer some questions. You know, why did I write this book? And America is such a great place, and I am so glad that I was born here. You know, I have traveled to 57 different countries, gotten to know lots of people and a lot of other ways of life. But this remains the place that is the land of dreams. And I know a lot of people like to criticize our nation, and demonize it, and say it's responsible for a lot of horrible things. And yet I see a lot of people trying to get in here, and not a lot of people trying to get out. So I'm not sure that that really is all that legitimate, to be honest with you. But, you know, growing up in poverty, with a lot of disadvantages, the thing that was really great is I was still able to focus on my dream of becoming a doctor. It was the only thing I ever wanted to do. I skipped right by policeman and fireman and went straight to doctor. And, you know, I loved anything that had to do with medicine. I even liked going to the doctor's office. And I would gladly sacrifice a shot just to be able to smell those alcohol swabs, you know, it was so cool. And on through the whole process, were there a lot of hurdles along the way? Absolutely, tremendous hurdles along the way. But, nevertheless, it was still possible to realize that dream. And I want to make sure that that continues to be the case. And one of the reasons that it was possible is because we have a system that did everything possible to create fairness, even when there were people in the system who did not want to be fair. And that's why it is so important that we must preserve our Constitution. Virtually all Americans know that we have a Constitution. But how many people actually know what's in it? And how many people actually know what's behind it? And, of course, it is the mechanism that guarantees our liberties and that provides the guidelines for the restraint of government. Because our founders recognized that it was the natural tendency of government to grow and to invade every aspect of your life and to try to control your life. That's what people do. And that's what they wanted to avoid by doing this. And that's why it's so important that we understand it. You know, in 1831, when Alexis DeTuddville came to America to study our great country, because the Europeans were just so flabbergasted that this fledgling nation, barely 50 years old, was already competing with them on virtually every level, he was going to really dissect it and see what was going on. But one of the things that really impressed him was how educated the people were. You know, anybody finishing the second grade was completely literate. He could find a mountain man on the outskirts of society and the guy could read the newspaper and could tell him how our government worked. And nowadays, we don't seem to emphasize, you know, civics and things like that in school anymore. And I'm sure some of you have seen some of those man on the street interview situations, where they go out and ask just really basic questions, and people have no clue what you're talking about. And you know, they think, you know, you say, Well who's the first President, and they say, Reagan? I mean they have no idea. And it's funny, but it's so sad, because our founders, and particularly Franklin and Jefferson, emphasized education, and they emphasized being informed. And they said, Our system of government and our freedoms are dependent on a well informed and educated populace, because they recognized that, if the people were not well informed, that they would be easy to manipulate. And all it would take was dishonest politicians and a complicit news media and off you would go into another direction very, very quickly. Now, I'll tell you right off the bat, before I go any further, I'm not politically correct. I will not be politically correct. And that's one of the reasons that a lot of the people in the press don't like me. But it's okay, because you know, what I really love is this country. I don't necessarily care whether the press likes me or not. And therefore, I'm not going to conform to all their little requirements. Like people ask me all the time, Well why don't you just do this and do this? And then they won't say bad things about you. Because this is America, that's why I'm not going to do that. And I never will do that. But I want to touch on some of the aspects of America that I touched on in the book, like the balance of powers, the check and balance system, the separation of powers. I believe this is so vitally important. And it was a touch of genius by our founders because they recognized that each branch, Executive, Judicial and Legislative would want to maintain their power. And therefore, they would push back against excesses in the other branches. And that works extraordinarily well in a government like we have when they all are exercising their power appropriately. Unfortunately, we have a legislative branch that really acts more like a peanut gallery. You know, they sort of sit there and watch what the others do, sometimes complain about it, but really don't offer any resistance, because they're afraid somebody might blame them. News flash, they're going to get blamed anyway. So what they really ought to be thinking about is how do they get involved and be more proactive? You know, case in point, I think about the recent decision by the Supreme Court on gay marriage. Now first of all, let me just say, I have nothing against gay people whatsoever. I know a lot of people don't believe that because we live in a society now where, if you don't accept their entire agenda, then you're a homophobe. But, you know, I personally believe that any two people, regardless of sexual orientation or anything else, have the right to associate together. If they want to have a legal contract drawn up which allows them to share property, have hospital visitation rights, do whatever they want, absolutely. I don't have any problem with that. That's the kind of country that this was designed to be, live and let live. Not impose your values on everybody else. And that's the problem. But with the Supreme Court ruling that changes essentially the definition of marriage, it doesn't take into consideration the implications of that. If you change it for one group, why won't you change it for the next? What defense do you have against the next group? You're going to say, We can only change it this one time. We're never going to change it again? Well that wouldn't be very fair. So why change it in the first place? It's been working very well for thousands of years. And that's what happens when people go in and start tinkering with things without thinking about the implications of it. And the legislative branch, however, I would have thought would have been already prepared with legislation in case the Supreme Court came down with that decision, to make sure we preserve the rights, the religious rights of everybody. Not everybody agrees with their new definition of marriage. And it's a conviction and a religious conviction. And they need to make sure that they protect people's religious rights. They bring Johnny Come Lately, but I call upon Congress to do that now, because there are people who are losing their jobs, their livelihood. And it's not fair. That's not what America was supposed to be. But, unless all the branches of government are functioning the right way, these are the kinds of things that happen, because there will be overreach by any of the branches, because they're composed of people and people are not perfect. But that's why we have the counterbalance in order to be able to rectify the situation, because one group may not take into consideration the ramifications of what they are doing. Also, the Constitution indicates that, you know, civil issues really should be dealt with at the local level, at the state level. There was a reason for that. It was because the legislators and the judiciary at the local level are subject to the will of the people. The people vote them in, the people vote them out. And our founders felt that the people should be the ones who determine how things worked and the standards by which they lived. When you take those issues and you bump them up to a level where the people making the decisions have no obligation whatsoever to the people, then you wind up with an oligarchy type government. That was not what the founders intended for America. So we are somehow going to have to look into ways to rebalance that, because if we continue down that pathway, you can see how virtually everything that they intended will be upset. We don't want that to happen. The Preamble to the Constitution talks about the role of the government in terms of promoting the general welfare. That doesn't mean that we want to put everybody on welfare. That's not what the general welfare is. It means that, when we do things, we want to do them in a way that they benefit the entire society. And it is very important, you know, that we take care, that we make sure that everybody is taken care of in an appropriate way. But, when I say we, that does not necessarily mean the federal government. You know, I get criticized sometimes, inappropriately by the way, by people who say, Carson grew up very poor. He must have benefited from some government programs. And now he wants to withdraw all the safety nets. Well this is nothing but a blatant lie by people who need to characterize me as heartless. They love to do that. They love to say, Carson is insensitive, and he's heartless, and he hates people, because they need that narrative. That's the only way that it can be acceptable, because I'm—I don't fit into their general description. You know, a black people who is a conservative? They can't quite deal with that. Who talks about self reliance, and that you're not dependent on them? Oh how could you possibly say such heresy? So, you know, it's necessary to demonize individuals like that. And I understand that. And I'm actually willing to fight with them. I will continue to fight with them. But I'm fighting for something even greater. And that is, I'm fighting for the people of the United States, because you see, we have very, very smart and very, very capable people in our nation who would be extremely good leaders, but they say, Why would I get into that cesspool and be attacked and have my family attacked and have people going through every aspect of my life and trying to demonize me? And people don't want to do that. Well, I am going to fight that fight for them. And if I am successful, I expect that maybe a lot more of the people in our country who are not professional politicians will say, You know what? He did it. I'm going to do it too. And I think we'll be much better off as a country when we once again understand that this country is for everybody and not for a specific political class. But as far as the whole safety net argument is concerned, my mother worked extraordinarily hard, three jobs at a time, leaving the house before five in the morning, getting back after midnight, because she didn't want to be dependent. And she occasionally accepted some aid. But, for the most part, was able to stay off of it. And she refused to be a victim. And she refused to let us be victims. And it wasn't that she didn't recognize that there were problems out there. But she chose to focus on other things. And she would say to us, If you walk into an auditorium full of bigoted, racist people, she said, You don't have a problem, they have a problem. She said, Because when you walk in there, they're all going to cringe and wonder if you're going to sit next to them. Whereas you can sit anywhere you want. And you know, that's kind of the way that I have chosen to lead my life. Have there been obstacles? Of course. Have there been racist people around? Of course there have. But I said, that's their problem. I've got some very important things that I need to do. So I can get wrapped up in their problem, or I can do the important things. Not everybody chooses to lead their life that way, and that's fine. But that's the way that I chose to lead mine. And it works pretty well, if I do say so myself. Having said that, I am very concerned about the downtrodden people in our society. And I do believe we have a responsibility to take care of them. But when I say we, I'm talking about we the people. I'm talking about the private sector. I'm not talking about the government. You know, the government has been taking this on really since Woodrow Wilson, but it kept increasing. By the time we got to Lyndon Johnson and the war on poverty, it was, hey, we're the savior, we're going to take care of you guys. We're going to solve all these problems. Well here we are, all these years later, $19 trillion dollars later, did we solve the problem? We have ten times more people on food stamps, more people in poverty, welfare, broken homes, out of wedlock births, crime, incarceration, everything that was supposed to be better is not only worse, it's much worse. So I'm not going to sit here and demonize the government for doing that, but I'm saying, isn't it time to wake up and start thinking about another way to do things, rather than driving ourselves into debt without solving the problem? And that is a tremendous responsibility of the government as well, to remain solvent, because you are the guardian of the people's future. I mean how can we enjoy the liberties and have our posterity, enjoy the liberties if they are overloaded with debt? $18 ½ trillion dollars, the national debt? Think about that. To pay that back at $10 million a day, it would take you over 5000 years. That's absurd. And we're putting that on the backs of our young people. And now, here we are, sitting here saying, oh, let's increase the debt some more. Let's raise the debt ceiling some more. Did it ever maybe occur to us that there's another way? I mean there are 4 million federal employees. I would offer that that's too many. And there are 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies, all of whom have budgets. This is absurd. And we've had people saying, If you cut the budget by one penny, it will be a disaster. Nancy Pelosi. You know, I mean, this is absolutely absurd, okay. But we must think about the children. And that really is the main reason that I've gotten into the fray here, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, my whole professional career centered on the children and on the future for the children. And what we had to do to improve quality of life for them. How can we in good conscience continue this charade of responsibility knowing what we are doing to their future? If I had time, I would really get into the fiscal gap and all the implications of that, and what the implications of the debt is on the Fed, and how they're irresponsibly printing money, and how the low interest rates are hurting the poor and the middle class because, you know, putting money into a savings account or buying bonds doesn't help them. The only people who can really make money are people who can have a risk tolerance which allows them to go into the stock market. And I would talk about the regulations and how every single regulation costs money in terms of goods and services, and how those are the things that are really impacting the middle class and the poor people. It doesn't matter for wealthy people if a bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it matters a lot for the middle class and for poor people. You think about that regulatory burden and who it is really hurting. You know, it goes on and on and on. When we're promoting the general welfare, those are the kinds of things we have to be thinking about. We have to be thinking about mechanisms for allowing the downtrodden in our society to escape from dependency and move up into the fabric of success in our country. And we have to understand that we only have 330 million people. Sounds like a lot, but China has over a billion, India has over a billion. We need to get the bang for the buck out of all of our people. We need to be thinking about policies that allow all of our people to rise and stop all this silly class warfare stuff. And we can get immediate, immediate stimulus by thinking about the over $2 trillion dollars that exist overseas right now. We need to bring that money back. I can remember many an afternoon sitting around the Board table at Kellogg or Costco, talking about the money overseas, and what we were going to do with it, and how we would love to bring it back in order to build another factory or do something else. But the corporate tax rates were too high. Well, what if we had a six month hiatus on those corporate taxes overseas, let that money be repatriated. I've been talking about this for several months. And we wouldn't— it wouldn't cost them anything to repatriate it. We would only request or require that 10 percent of it be used in enterprise zones that are set up in our major cities or to provide employment for people who are unemployed or on welfare. You want to talk about an incredible stimulus that didn't cost the taxpayers one penny, that would be the biggest stimulus probably since FDR's New Deal. That's low hanging fruit. It's low hanging fruit. And you know, that's what we've got to do, deal with this low hanging fruit. The other thing is, it gets business and industry once again thinking about how do we invest in the people around us? This is what we used to do, before the government started taking over everything, because Americans are very generous people. You think about the early America, and you had these communities all over the place, in many cases separated by hundreds of miles. How did they survive, and how did they thrive? Because at harvest time, if a farmer was up in an apple tree picking apples and fell out and broke his leg, everybody else pitched in and harvested his crops. If somebody got killed, everybody else pitched in and took care of their family. That's who we are. When there's disaster in the world, who is always on the front line? It's us. So let's utilize that and recognize that we are our brother's keeper, and it is our duty to take care of the indigent, it is not the duty of the government. And if we learn that And then, another important aspect of our government is to provide for the common defense. Now I could talk about this for a long time. But simply to allow our military to deteriorate the way it has, to fail to take care of our veterans to the point where we have 22 to 23 suicides every day, it makes absolutely no sense. To leave our electric grid unprotected, it needs to be hardened. We need to have several layers of alternative energy. You know, this is criminal what we're doing, because we are so vulnerable. And, you know, we need to really beef up our cyber capabilities. And I'll tell you, under a Carson administration, if another country attacks us with a cyber attack, they're going to get hit so hard, it's going to take them a long time to recover. We can't sit around and let people do stuff and just say, You're bad. I don't like you, you know. We can't do that. And, you know, we have to understand. We also need to reinvigorate our space program. I think it is a crime that we have moved away from that. Think about all the inventions, the innovation that came out of that. Your cell phone, so many things. And the important thing is, in the future, he who controls space controls the earth. We cannot be tardy to that when there are others who are working very hard in order to conquer that area. And then, the last area I just wanted to mention briefly, and I could really go on for quite a while on this one, but there is only one business in America that is protected by the Constitution. And that is the press. And there was a reason for that. It was because the press was supposed to be an ally of the people. And they were supposed to expose and inform the people in a nonpartisan way. When they become partisan, which they are, they distort the system as it was supposed to work. And they allow the side that they pick to get away with all kinds of things. And I think there's still hope for the press. I think it is possible that some of them will recognize that it's almost a sacred obligation that they have to the people to be honest. Now you know, just in the last week, in my own case, they take something that I say about the shootings in Oregon, and don't put the part in where I was answering the question, don't put the question in, just give the response, and say, See, he's being critical of the people. I mean the good thing is that a lot of the people in America are onto them and understand what they're trying to do. And that's one of the reasons we're doing well. And it seems like the more they attack me, the better we do, because people expect that, you know. And last week, I'm leaving a press conference, getting ready to get on a bus, and the reporter says, Can you tell me what you're going to do about hurricanes? I said, Goodbye. I don't know. The next day, Carson wants to be President, has no idea what to do about hurricanes, you know. This is the level of insincerity that we see. And it really is kind of embarrassing to see that. And it happens on the other side, too. It's not just on one side, you know. I was doing an interview with Wolf Blitzer yesterday, and he was asking about renewal of the Voting Rights Act. And of course I want renewal of the Voting Rights Act, or at least an aspect of it that protects all Americans' rights to vote. But it's a much longer conversation about what needs to be done to it before it is renewed. It was something based on conditions 50 or 60 years ago. A lot of things have changed since that time. We certainly don't want to empower the Department of Justice to do some of the things that the Holder Justice Department did based on that bill. So everything needs to be looked at in its context. And when news media pick one word or one phrase and they run with it and they try to characterize people like that, I got to tell you guys, that's why people don't trust you anymore. I mean you're down there with used car salesmen. And, you know, we should. So what is it going to take to save our country? Courage. It's going to take courage by all of us, including the press. And we have to begin to think about those who come behind us. Because what would have happened to us if those who preceded us were little chicken livers? What if they weren't willing to take risk? What if on D-Day our soldiers invading the beaches of Normandy had seen their colleagues being cut down, 100 bodies laying in the sand, 1000 bodies laying in the sand? What if they had been frightened and turned back? Well I guarantee you, they were frightened. But they didn't turn back. They stepped over the bodies of their colleagues, knowing in many cases that they would never see their homeland or their loved ones again. And they stormed those Axis troops. And they took that beach, and they died. Why did they do that? They didn't do it for themselves, they did it for you, and they did it for me. And now it's our turn. And what are we willing to do for our children and for our grandchildren? Are we willing to stand up? Or are we afraid that somebody is going to call us a nasty name, or that we're going to get an IRS audit, or that somebody is going to mess with our job? You know, we have a lot less to lose than they did. And the people who were always telling me, Hang in there, don't let them get to you, believe me, do not worry about it, because the stakes are much too high. Thank you very much. Thank you all very much, and thank you very much to the folks at the Press Club for having me, and good morning. Look, today I want to put aside my own political mission, my own campaign just for a moment. I want to talk about something more important than myself or any single candidate. The idea of America is slipping away from us. What do I mean by that? We're on the path towards socialism. In America today, we've got over $18 trillion of debt, Planned Parenthood is dismembering and selling babies across the country. The idea of America is slipping away from us. That is the context for what I want to talk about today. Yet, there was a great opportunity for us to get our country back. There is a hunger to get America back. I see it in the polls, I see it in people's eyes, in the early states. You see it all around us. People are hungry and eager to get the idea of America back. I believe our country is ready for it. The liberalism, the incompetence of the Obama Administration have brought us to the edge. The idea of America is slipping away. The people can see it and they're demanding radical change. They're demanding that we get back on the path to greatness. The American people have a massive appetite for a rebirth, a massive appetite for making America great again. That is the context and the reason for my remarks today. I want to start by saying I like the idea of Donald Trump. I like the idea of an outsider. I like the idea of somebody willing to say the things you're not supposed to say. I like the idea of somebody going after the DC political class. The reality is they are full of foolishness and nonsense. Donald Trump's diagnosis is exactly right. The political class is the problem. The problem is Donald Trump's prescription is exactly wrong. His diagnosis on the political class is right, his prescription is wrong. His prescription is that he is the solution. Donald Trump's not the solution. The problem is that Donald Trump himself is full of foolishness and nonsense as well. Now look, I'll start by saying I like the idea of Donald Trump and I like the show. I like the Donald Trump act and show. It's a lot of fun, it's entertainment. I laughed when he went on live TV and gave our Lindsey Graham's cell phone number. I thought it was pretty entertaining when he said that audiences were falling asleep at Jeb Bush's rallies. I thought it was great when he gave helicopter rides to kids at the Iowa State Fair. It's been a lot of fun. But here's the problem: Donald Trump is not a serious candidate. He's a narcissist. He's an egomaniac. The only thing he believes in is himself. The reality is that I want to say what everybody is thinking about Donald Trump but afraid to say. Everybody knows this is true. This shouldn't be new. The idea of the Donald Trump act is great. The reality of Donald Trump, however, is absurd. He's non serious. He's a carnival act. Here's the truth about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is shallow. He has no understanding of policy. He is full of bluster. He has no substance. He lacks the intellectual curiosity to even learn. You can't argue policy with this guy. The only thing that Donald Trump believes in is himself. Look, he tells us that his healthcare plan's going to be fabulous. He tells us his tax plan will be really, really terrific. He is shallow, there is no substance. He doesn't know anything about policy. He has no idea what he's talking about. He makes it up on the fly. He doesn't believe in limited government. He has told us that. Over and over from his belief in socialized medicine to his desire for tax increases. He has told us over and over that he's got no problem with big, top down style government. The only government he's got with DC today, he has no problem with big top down style government. His only problem is he's not the one running it today. Donald Trump's not against big government, he's just against the folks that happen to be running it. Donald Trump is for Donald Trump. He believes in nothing other than himself. Look, he's not a liberal, he's not a moderate, he's not a conservative. He's not a Democrat, he's not a Republican, he's not an independent. Donald Trump is for Donald Trump. He's not for anything, he's not against anything. Issues don't mean anything to him. Policies, ideals, they're not important to him, he is for Donald. Donald Trump is a narcissist and he's an egomaniac. Now, that may sound like a serious charge to make. But it is something that everybody knows to be true. He knows it, too, he celebrates it. He says Kanye West is great. Why is Kanye West great? Well, because Kanye West likes Trump. So therefore, Kanye West is great. He's an entertaining narcissist, but he's still a narcissist. Like all narcissist, Donald Trump is insecure and weak. He's afraid of being exposed. That's why he tells us always and constantly how big and strong and wealthy he is. Look, we all know that, we've all met people like Donald Trump who continue to tell us how insignificant everybody else is. We know that only a very weak and small person needs to constantly tell us how strong and powerful they are. Donald Trump believes he is the answer to every question. Donald Trump is dangerous, but not in the way you think. The reality is we have an incredible opportunity to turn our country around and the question for conservatives is this: are we going to rely and trust proven conservative principles or are we going to turn to a man who believes in nothing but himself? And that is the most essential question we've got to answer right now. Are we going to miss this great opportunity? Are we going to apply conservative principles, or do we trust a man who believes in nothing but himself? That's what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Many people think he's dangerous, they say, Well, you wouldn't want somebody like that with such a hot head with his fingers on the nuclear codes. And yeah, that's certainly true. That's not the real danger. The real danger is that ironically Donald Trump could destroy America's chance to be great again. And as conservatives, we must not miss this golden opportunity. The Democratic Party has terribly, incredibly screwed things up. Look, they've run our country into the ground. They're destroying our economy, they've screwed up our foreign policy. We're about to allow Iran to become a nuclear power. They're running their weakest candidate who's running the weakest possible campaign. They are giving us this election on a sliver platter. But if we blow this opportunity, we may never get it again. And this election's not just about the Republican Party or about conservatives, it is about saving our country. It is about rescuing the idea of America, making America great again. Donald Trump is not a serious act. He is not a serious person. Look, it's all just an act, it's all just a solo show. The joke's on us. He's laughing all the way to the bank or the polling station. P. T. Barnum was never more right than right now. Now, you may have recently heard and seen that Donald Trump said that the Bible was his favorite book. Yet when asked, he couldn't even name a specific or a single Bible verse that was important to him, that had an impact on him. Well, do you know why? Well, it's clear, Donald Trump's never read the Bible. The reason we know he's never read the Bible, he's not in the Bible. Folks, Donald Trump is not a serious person. This is a carnival act. These are serious times for our country. The Democrats have practically gift wrapped this election for us. The whole thing is set up for us to win. Now, we are flirting with nominating a non serious, unstable, substance free candidate. We cannot send this narcissist, we cannot nominate this egomaniac. Nominating Donald Trump is a certain way for us to ruin our opportunity to make America great again. Look, the silly summer season is over. It's time to get serious about saving our country. It's time to send Donald Trump back to reality TV. It's time to tell him, Look, you've been great. You've been great for ratings. It's been great fun. You've been almost as good as Don Rickles. The show's been a blast. And he was right when he borrowed Ronald Reagan's theme saying that we need to make America great again. We do need to make America great again. We do need to fire everybody in Washington. We do, in fact, need to get rid of political correctness. All of that is true. We can make America great again. But we will not do that by putting an unserious and unstable narcissist in the White House. Our country is worth saving. This is our time to save it. The conservative cause deserves more than a power hungry shark. He eats whatever is in front of him. Sooner or later, we will be his next meal. This is our moment, this is our time. We can win right now, or we can be the biggest fools of all time and put our faith not in our principles but in an egomaniacal madman who has no principles. If we nominate him, he will self destruct in a general election. He may be the greatest gift, the last that Hillary Clinton actually has. But even worse, if you're a conservative, even if he were to win, it doesn't matter. He believes in nothing. We have no idea what he would actually do in the White House. Folks it is time to get serious about making America great again. It is time for Donald Trump to take the ride down the elevator. It is time for us to tell him, Donald, you are fired. It is time to tell him we will not put an egomaniacal, unserious person in the White House. We need to put a committed conservative in the White House, one who will make our country great again, who will ignore the professional political class in Washington, D. C. Donald Trump's campaign is not about making America great again, it's about making Donald Trump great. Look, obviously I think I'm the right man for this job. But the voters will make that decision. America is ready for a politically incorrect, committed conservative candidate. If I haven't been clear, I think the Donald Trump show's been entertaining, I've enjoyed him as a reality TV show star, but just because a lot of people like watching Kim Kardashian, we wouldn't put her in the White House, either. He is an unserious, unstable, narcissistic egomaniac. It is time for us to put a serious, committed conservative. Let's make America great again. It starts by firing Donald Trump. Thank you, and I'll look forward to taking your questions. Thank you all very much. My new phone. Yeah, I went with the iPhone, so I'm sure their stock will, the number is not part of the speech. To the Press Club, thanks a ton. A real in-depth analysis of will be had tomorrow on the steps of the capitol when Trump and Cruz speak, but I'll bore you between now and then with what I think. I think I am lucky to be here to talk about something so important to so many distinguished people who jealously guard the First Amendment. It is in your care. Use it wisely. And I don't give many written speeches, but this is too important. I can't think of a thing I am, that I have done in the Senate more important than what this week and maybe next will behold. President Obama's deal with Iran could only be reached through a long series of mistakes and miscalculation. His biggest mistake of all was disassociate Iran's destabilizing behavior from their nuclear ambitions. By separating the two Obama opened up funding for the war machine of the world's greatest sponsor of terror. This was a strategic blunder for the ages. As to Israel, this deal empowers their chief antagonist with more money, more weapons, and a pathway to a bomb. To my Democratic colleagues who say this agreement saves Israel and secures its future I could not disagree more strongly. Every single major political party in Israel, not just Likud, opposes this deal because they know it gives the Ayatollah the ability to make his chants of death to Israel a reality. If this agreement does not dramatically change it could very well become a death sentence for the state of Israel. I believe the Ayatollah is compelled by its religious beliefs to do three things: Purify its religion, destroy the one and only Jewish state, and attack democracies like ours. There is no place in the Ayatollah's world for religious tolerance, peaceful dissent, or the selection of leaders by the people. Some of the collateral damage from Obama's fixation with the deal, with an Iranian deal at any cost has been the unchecked provocations of Russia and China. In the face of Russian intervention in Ukraine and its support for Assad or China's aggression against its neighbors President Obama has refused to push back, because he needs Moscow and Beijing in order to reach a deal with Iran. As a result, the losers of this deal include American businesses and government officials who have been cyberattacked by China, the good people of Ukraine, the overwhelming majority of Syrians who have had to suffer under Assad's oppression, all because Obama has been unwilling to counter these provocations in a forceful manner for fear of jeopardizing his agreement. The biggest losers of all are the Iranian people themselves, those who years for freedom and to see the end of oppression by the Ayatollah and his henchmen. This agreement empowers the Ayatollah, makes it far more difficult for the Iranian people to unshackle themselves from this oppressive religious theocracy. When the history of these times has been written unfortunately I believe it will be said that President Obama was a weak opponent of evil and a poor champion of freedom. His nuclear deal with Iran is the great miscalculation of his Presidency. In an administration marked by failing policies here at home and around the world, this deal will prove to be his most consequential failure. He went to the negotiating table without understanding who he was dealing with and he went to the table as a weakened President who has long been broadcasting to our enemies and the world at large that they will not be confronted. Having disastrously and permanently withdrawn from Iraq, drawing red lines in Syria and then backing down, and making it crystal clear that a military option was not really on the table, he set the stage for negotiation with Iran that could only go one way. Just as Obama's position of weakness was crystal clear, it should also have been very clear in what kind of adversary we were dealing with. Iran has been run by a radical, fanatical regime for over three and a half decades. Their nuclear ambitions, their hatred for the US and Israel, their support for terror, their religious fanaticism are all well known. Even if President Obama entered office without understanding this regime, history had given him a crash course in 2009. Two years before the Arab Spring broke out the people of Iran began to revolt against their tyrannical government. The Ayatollah had rigged the Presidential election and the people of Iran knew it. Within hours of the announcement of the stolen election hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets, demanding nothing more than their democratic rights. This green revolution, as it was called, made up of political and religious moderates, young, women, workers, and anyone who wanted a better life all stood up to peacefully but forcefully demand a new kind of Iran. The reaction of the Ayatollah was swift, barbaric. Dozens were killed in cold blood and hundreds more were jailed, many of whom were tortured and tried in sham trials. At this point Iran had reached a crossroads. Either this green revolution would succeed in bringing about real change in Tehran or the radical Islamic government would succeed in squashing this movement. The United States was at a crossroads too. President Obama had a clear choice, stand with the people of Iran or remain on the sidelines during the brutal crackdown. At this pivotal moment President Obama chose to remain on the sidelines. The religious Nazis running Iran faced no consequences for their actions. The people of Iran received no support. Without the support of the world's greatest democracy their effort was doomed. The Ayatollah and his henchman, the Revolutionary Guard, killed, jailed, or terrified into silence every Iranian moderate. In the six years since there has been no sign of that resistance. Their crackdown was complete. The cost of protest clearly too high. What happened in 2009 helped sharpen the world's focus on this fanatical regime. In the years following those of us who had long understood the threat from Iran redoubled our efforts to step up the pressure. The US Congress put the screws to the Iranian government, cutting off access to global markets, especially Western financial institutions. Our allies followed our lead. We painstakingly built an international consensus on Iran. I helped to lead this effort because I believed then and I believe now that the single greatest threat to our security as a nation is the prospect of a nuclear Iran. Iran in turn felt the deep pain inflicted by the united approach to sanctions and agreed to come to the negotiating table. This was a critical moment. We had backed Iran into a corner. What we needed then more than ever was a tough American President, someone who wanted a deal but not so badly they would take a bad one, a President who credibly put all options on the table so that Iran knew we meant business, a President who laid out negotiating objectives and stuck to them, a President who without a shred of doubt would do whatever it took to defend America. But that is not the President we had. We had a President who projected weakness and clearly didn't understand who he was dealing with, but believe me they knew exactly who they were dealing with. They saw President Obama's weakness and they took every possible advantage of it. While John Kerry was giving away the farm at the negotiating table his own State Department was writing report detailing Iran's terror campaign throughout the Mideast. This report outlined very clearly the money, arms, and training Iran was providing to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas who attacked the state of Israel. In the case of Hezbollah holds the government in Lebanon hostage. While the Obama administration was giving away our ability to dismantle Iran's nuclear program Iran was propping up Bashar Al-Assad, prolonging the Syrian conflict, giving rise to ISIL, the world's most devastating humanitarian crisis unfolds before our eyes. While our negotiators were giving up on any time anywhere inspections Iran was destabilizing Iraq, reviving sectarian tensions with a Shiite militia, paving the way for ISIL to move in and undo the gains made by American troops. While President Obama was backing down from every single negotiating objective he had laid out Iran was taking down the government of Yemen through their proxies the Hudis. They toppled this pro US government and crippled our ability to monitor Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In short, Iran set the entire Middle East on fire, taking over four Arab capitals and creating conditions for the most devastating and sophisticated attacks against our homeland, all while negotiating with the Obama administration. And what did they get at the end of that negotiation? A deal that gives them a nuclear bomb, a missile to deliver it, and the money to pay for it. The disastrous failings of this agreement are well known by now. It gives the Ayatollah immediate cash infusion of 100 billion dollars without any requirement that changes behavior. It allows the Iranians, even if they abide by the agreement, to arrive at a threshold of being a nuclear arms state in just a few short years. And of course we now all know they will not abide by this agreement. They have constantly lied and cheated from day one about their nuclear weapons program and at the end of the day the verification systems in this agreement are little more than a joke. This agreement lifts bans on ballistic missiles and conventional weapons and the launch of this deal hinges on a secret deal between the IAEA and Iran regarding the possible military dimensions of their program. So far Congress and the American people have been barred from seeing this agreement, but we know at the very least, thanks to the press, it leaves inspections in the hands of the Iranians themselves. Today the Senate begins its debate on this deal. I have spent every day since this deal analyzing it, talking with experts in the region, and trying to make the case to the American people as to why this is so dangerous. I will continue making the case on the Senate floor, encouraging my Democratic colleagues to put our security above politics. Regardless how the vote goes, the fight for a better deal will not end. I am leading the effort to impose additional sanctions on the Iranian regime until all of our hostages are released, including Jason. I will support re imposing the current sanctions before they expire at the end of 2016. I will also block funding for the IAEA until they come clean about their side deal with Iran. I will not let up until we change course, force Iran back to the table, and get a better deal. President Obama says that our choice is between this deal and war. He says that there is no better deal to be had. He is half right. There is no better deal to be had from a President who negotiates from weakness, but the right President will get the right deal. As President I will say to the Iranians you can have a peaceful nuclear energy program, you can have sanctions relief, but first you will completely dismantle your nuclear weapons program, you will abandon your support for terror, you will submit to inspections any time anywhere so that we know you are not cheating, and you will not get a penny of sanctions relief or one more bullet until we know you have complied and you have changed your behavior. That is the deal. If you reject those terms and walk away that is your choice. If Iran tries to break out they will be stopped. To achieve this better deal I will work with the Congress to impose new sanctions that will put off limits American banking system to any company that would do business with Iran. I believe having the choice between the Iranian economy and the American banking system would create tremendous leverage that I would use wisely. I am running for President because this is the deal we need. It is the only deal that will secure our nation, protect our closest allies like Israel, and assure our Arab allies that they do not need to pursue nuclear weapons on their own. President Obama can't get this deal. He has neither the will nor the understanding of the Mideast, but I do. I have spent months on the ground through dozens of trips to the region as a Senator and a member of the United States Air Force. I know the key players. More important, they know me. As President I will get us a better deal and do what it takes to make sure Iran never achieves the ability to hit us at home. Thank you very much. Thank you. It was 99 years ago, on the 15th day of May, 1916, at a Courthouse in Waco, Texas, there was a mentally disabled 17 year old boy. His name was Jesse Washington. He was convicted of raping and murdering the wife of his employer. He pled guilty, and he was sentenced to death. But Jesse died no ordinary death, because he was black. After the death sentence was issued, Jesse was dragged out of the McLennan County Courthouse, into a crowd of hundreds. And thanks to the advent of this new technology called the telephone, word spread rather quickly to what was about to happen. And soon there were 15000 people watching Jesse Washington be tortured, to be mutilated, to be tied to a tree. Someone lit a fire under Jesse and raised him up in the air. Jesse tried to climb up the chains to keep from being consumed by that fire. Someone started cutting his fingers off, so that he could not climb that chain. One man castrated him. Another used a pole to prevent him from pulling himself away from the fire. There was a prominent local photographer who took pictures of Jesse's charred remains and sold them as souvenirs on a postcard. Even today, we Texans struggle to talk about what happened to Jesse Washington. We don't want to believe that our great state could ever have been the scene of such unimaginable horror. But it is an episode in our history that we cannot ignore. It is an episode that we have an obligation to transcend. Now we made a lot of progress since 1916. A half a century ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to finally enshrine into law the principle that all of us, regardless of race, color, of national origin, are created equal. Shedrich Willis, he was a slave. This was before the Civil War. He had been bought and sold on the Courthouse steps of McLennan County, Texas, the same courthouse where Jesse Washington would later be drugged down and brought to death. When I was the Governor of Texas, I had the proud distinction of appointing Willis, Shedrich Willis's great great great grandson to be the first African American Justice on the Texas Supreme Court. In 2004, I appointed Wallace to be the Supreme Court's first Chief Justice. You see, there are tens of thousands of stories like Wallace Jefferson's. When it comes to race, America is a better and more tolerant and more welcoming place than it's ever been before. We're a country with Hispanic CEOs, with Asian billionaires, with a black President. So why is it, today, so many black families feel left behind? Why is it that a quarter of African Americans live below the poverty line, even after the impact of federal programs like food stamps and housing subsidies? The supplemental poverty rate for African Americans is nearly double the rate for other Americans. Democrats have long had the opportunity to govern the African American communities. It is time for black families to hold them accountable for the results. And I'm here to tell you that it's Republicans, not Democrats, who are truly offering black Americans the hope for a better life for themselves and their children. I'm proud to live in a country that has an African American President. But President Obama cannot be proud of the fact that the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership. We cannot dismiss the historical legacy of slavery, nor its role in causing the problem of black poverty. And because slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a role for government policy in addressing their lasting effects. But the specific policies, advanced by the President and his allies on the left, amount to little more than throwing money at the problem and walking away. We spend $450 billion a year on Medicaid. And yet health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than those who have no health insurance at all. Instead of reforming Medicaid, the President expanded it under Obamacare. In the cities where left wing solutions have been tried over and over again, places like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore, African Americans are moving out. And they're moving to cities like Houston and Dallas. Listen, as Americans, I think we are all—we're all united by certain aspirations. We want access to opportunity. We want good schools for our kids. We want to live in safe neighborhoods. We want to live in cities and states where housing and college and everyday expenses are affordable. We want to all experience the American dream. From 2005 to 2007 more African Americans moved to Texas than all but one other state, that state being Georgia. Now many were coming from blue states, like New York and Illinois and California. Many came from Louisiana, where they had lost their homes due to Hurricane Katrina. But each one of those new residents were welcomed to Texas with open arms. They came to a state with a booming economy. We kept taxes low, regulations low. We kept frivolous lawsuits to a minimum. We worked hard to educate every child. Now let me be clear, we have not eliminated black poverty in Texas. But we have made meaningful progress. In New York, the supplemental poverty rate for blacks is 26 percent. In California, it is 30 percent. In Washington, DC it is 33 percent. In Texas, it is just 20 percent. And here is how it happened. We curtailed frivolous lawsuits and unreasonable regulations. It's far cheaper to do business in Dallas or Houston than it is in Baltimore or in Detroit. And those lower costs, they get passed down to consumers, especially low income consumers in the form of lower prices. There's a lot of talk in Washington about inequality, income inequality. But there is a lot less talk about the inequality that arises from the high cost of everyday life. In blue state coastal cities you have these strict zoning laws, environmental regulations that have prevented buildings from expanding the housing supply. And that may be great for the venture capitalist who wants to keep a nice view of San Francisco Bay. But it's not so great for the single mother working two jobs in order to pay rent and still put food on the table for her kids. It's not just about how many dollars you earn, though there are still pretty substantial opportunities for that in the State of Texas. It's also about how far each dollar that you do earn can take you. After you've paid your taxes, you've paid your rent, your tuition, your grocery bills. In too many parts of this country, black students are trapped in failing schools, where union bosses look out after themselves at the expense of the kids. And this matters, because kids who graduate from high school typically make 50 percent more than those who don't. In Texas, we made sure that the kids came first. Texas high school graduation rates were 27th in the nation in 2002. In 2013, they were the 2nd highest in America. Our most recent graduation rate for African Americans, number one in this country, 13 percentage points higher than the national average. That matters. We also found a way to reduce crime, while we're also keeping kids out of jail. In 2014 Texas had the lowest crime rate since 1968. And, at the same time, we closed three prisons and reformed our sentencing laws. Too many prisons—or I should say too many Texans were going to prison for nonviolent drug offenses. And, once they got out of prison, many of them found they couldn't get a job because they had a criminal record. I'm pretty sure nobody in here gets confused that Texas is a soft on crime place. But I also believe, like Texans believe, in consequences for criminal behavior, but I also believe in second chances and human redemption, because that too is part of the American story. Americans who suffer from an addiction need help. They don't need moral condemnation. By treating alcohol and drug abuse as a disease, we've given Texans who have experienced a run in with the law the help that they need, the rehabilitation that many seek. And now, many of those individuals are living in recovery. They're engaged in saving the lives of others who are trapped in addiction. You see, the human soul yearns to be free, free from the chains of addiction, free from the chains of poverty. I'm running for President because I want to make life better for all people, even those that don't vote Republican. I know Republicans have much to do to earn the trust of African Americans. Blacks know that Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964 ran against Lyndon Johnson, who was a champion for Civil Rights. They know that Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He felt parts of it were unconstitutional. States supporting segregation in the south, they cited states' rights as a justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table. As you know, I am an ardent believer in the 10th Amendment, which was ratified in 1791, as part of our Bill of Rights. The 10th Amendment says that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved for the states respectively, or the individual. I know that state governments are more accountable to you than the federal government. But I'm also an ardent believer in the 14th Amendment, which says that no state shall deny any person in its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. There has been, and there will continue to be an important and a legitimate role for the federal government in enforcing Civil Rights. Too often, we Republicans, me included, have emphasized our message on the 10th Amendment but not our message on the 14th. An Amendment, it bears reminding, that was one of the great contributions of Republican party to American life, second only to the abolition of slavery. For too long, we Republicans have been content to lose the black vote, because we found we didn't need it to win. But, when we gave up trying to win the support of African Americans, we lost our moral legitimacy as the party of Lincoln, as the party of equal opportunity for all. It's time for us, once again, to reclaim our heritage as the only party in our country founded on the principle of freedom for African Americans. We know what Democrats will propose in 2016, the same thing, the same things that Democrats have proposed for decades, more government spending on more government programs. And there is a proper and an important role for government assistance in keeping people on their feet. But few Presidents have done more to expand government assistance than President Obama. Today we spend nearly one trillion dollars a year on means tested antipoverty programs. And yet, black poverty remains stagnant. Here is what I have seen in my time in public office. The best welfare program in America is a job. There is a fundamental reason why Democratic policies have failed to cure poverty, is because the only true cure for poverty is a job. And Democratic policies have made it too hard for the poor to find a job. Just this week, the President announced new regulations for overtime pay that will make it costlier for companies to hire full time employees. Companies are going to respond to this by hiring fewer people, simply because money doesn't grow on trees. So my first priority as President of this country will be to reignite the engine of economic growth by reforming the tax code, requiring federal agencies to adhere to strict regulatory budgets. A growing economy will give those at the bottom of the ladder more opportunities to climb, just like we did in Texas. Many poor Americans want to leave welfare. They want to rejoin the workforce. But, because of taxes and regulations, it often makes more economic sense to stay on welfare than to take that full time job. Furthermore, federal programs impose a one size fits all approach to fighting poverty. You think about this, in California, you may be substantially more in need for money to pay for the cost of housing, because of the high cost of housing in that state. In Massachusetts, it may be the cost of vocational school that you're more interested in. Instead, we force the poor to enroll in these separate programs for housing assistance and for Pell grants. If I'm elected President, I'm going to send Congress a welfare reform bill that will take the money that we already spend on non healthcare related anti poverty programs, and split them into two parts. The first part will be an expanded and reformed version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, so that anyone with a job can live above the poverty level. The second part will consist of a block grant so that states can care and put into place that safety net for their population in a manner that best serves their citizens. As I mentioned earlier, one of the most important things that we did in Texas while I was Governor was to reform our drug related sentencing laws, so that nonviolent offenders could stay out of prison. As Texans got smarter about policing and crime prevention, we came to appreciate the importance of keeping promising young people out of prison. Just imagine how hard it is to get a job if you've got a criminal record. We're working to stop the intergenerational cycle of incarceration, where grandchildren meet their grandparents behind prison bars. We can reform the federal sentencing laws just as we've done at the state level, to ensure more young people have a real shot at life. And we can do so while keeping our low income communities safe from crime as well. We all know, we all know we have to improve our schools. This is an area where President Obama had some substantial potential, but he caved into the demands of the labor unions. It is a fallacy to assume that the vastly different student populations across this country can be adequately educated with a one size fits all mentality in policy. We need to empower state lawmakers, the school boards, the parents to implement policies that address the specific needs of their students, and to keep those schools accountable and efficient. You know, enterprising charter school teachers, like Eva Moskowitz up in New York, you know, they should be able to replicate their astounding success all across this country without the interference of the federal government. And we also have to attack this challenge that we have with the exorbitant price of a college education today. One of the biggest barriers today into entering into the middle class, whether you're black or otherwise, is the high cost of a college degree. A four year degree at the typical private university in this country costs $170000. Now compare that to the medium home price in this country, is $205000. We are literally asking poor students to mortgage their future in order to gain a college degree. And that has to end. It must end. In Texas, I challenged our state universities to offer a four year college degree for less than $10000. Now many thought that that would be impossible. You just couldn't drive tuition and fees that low. But today, there are 13 Texas universities that have reached that target. We're on the cusp of an online revolution in higher education, but only if the federal government rolls back the rules that make it almost impossible for students to gain accreditation for a Bachelors Degree achieved from online instruction. Furthermore, just as with college tuition, we have to reduce the cost of living for those who need every dollar to be stretched as far as it can go. Federal regulations, like Obamacare's employer mandate, they are driving up the cost of hiring new workers. That means that companies are hiring fewer people. It also means that the price of basic consumer goods are going up. Earlier this year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimated that the federal regulations cost American businesses as much as $1 trillion dollars per year. That's nearly $15000 per household in this country. When you add state regulations to it, the problem just gets even worse. I will suggest to you, if we'll do five things, if we create jobs, if we incentivize work, if we keep nonviolent drug offenders out of prison, if we reform our schools, and we reduce the cost of living, we will have done more for African Americans than the last three Democrat administrations combined. At the American Cemetery in Normandy, above Omaha Beach, there are 9387 American soldiers buried, in row after orderly row. If ever proof were needed that we fought for a cause and not a conquest, an American General once said, It could be found in these cemeteries. Here was our only conquest, all we asked was enough soil in which to bury our gallant dead. Some of those gallant dead in that cemetery were sons of a United States President. But most were ordinary Americans, simply doing what their country had asked them to do. Some of the graves don't even have names. They simply are marked Here rests, in honored glory, a comrade in arms known but to God. Some of the most compelling graves at Normandy are for African Americans who served in segregated regiments, like Willie Collins for the 490th Port Battalion. Willie Collins made the ultimate sacrifice for America, despite the fact that America didn't always treat him the way he deserved. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Sergeant Willie Collins grew up in very different circumstances. See Ted's ancestors had a Coat of Arms. Willie's ancestors came here in chains. But Ted and Willie, they joined—joined themselves together. With this commitment that every generation of Americans have embraced, the promise of leaving America and the world a better place than they found it, of ensuring a better future for the children and grandchildren of those to come. I am a beneficiary of the sacrifices of Sergeant Collins and General Roosevelt and so many others known only to God. I grew up in this place called Paint Creek. When I was young, we had an outhouse. Mama bathed us on the front porch in a number 2 wash tub. We attended Paint Creek School. Some of our teachers literally lived on that campus. Their profession was literally their lives. And they inspired me. And I can assure you that none of them knew, had any idea that they would be educating a future Captain in the United States Air Force, and certainly not a future Governor of Texas. They've got a motto at the Paint Creek School that summarizes the endless possibilities for its students. It says, No dream too tall for a school so small. Many people today don't feel that their lives are filled with that endless possibilities anymore. Americans entering adulthood today have good reason to fear it will be harder for them to earn a living, to buy a home, to pay off their debts as their parents did. But, if there is one thing that we can learn from Willie Collins and the millions like him, from the tragedy of Jesse Washington and the triumph of Wallace Jefferson, it's that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones that we face today. Willie Collins died in the belief that America could become a better country than the one that he left home to serve, and he was right. It's up to us to be worthy of the country that Willie Collins' generation gave us. It's up to us to leave our country better off than we found it. America has never been perfect. No country composed of imperfect beings ever could be. But there is no country that has achieved more than the United States of America. And with new leadership, and with durable reforms, America can be stronger, more prosperous than it's ever been before. America can be this incredibly exceptional place, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we all have equal opportunity to build a better life for ourselves, for our children, and for our children's children. Thank you and God bless you. It's a long way from a little brick rent house on 2nd street in Hope, AR to the White House. But here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed a kid could go from Hope to Higher Ground. Like a lot of Americans, I grew up in a small town far removed from the power, the money, and the influence that runs the country. But power and money and political influence have left a lot of Americans lagging behind. They work hard, lift heavy things and sweat through their clothes grinding out a living, but they can't seem to get ahead or in some cases, even stay even. My parents were like that. My Dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. He and my mother didn't have much, but they had honesty to the bone, and taught me the basic lesson of life that I was to do unto others as I would have others do unto me. It was here in Hope that I learned how to swim, how to ride a bike, how to read, how to work, and how to play fair. I learned the difference between right and wrong. I learned that God loves me as much as He loves anyone, but that He doesn't love some more than others. I learned about America. In Miss Mary's Kindergarten and Brookwood Elementary School, I learned the pledge of allegiance, the Lord's Prayer, and Preamble to the Constitution. We prayed at the start of each day and before lunch. I learned that this exceptional country could only be explained by the Providence of God. I learned how to handle a firearm and a fishing pole and spent many hours with both. I got my first BB gun at age five a Daisy model 25 that I still have and that's in mint condition. I learned the basic rules of gun safety and never thought of using a firearm to murder someone. I ran trotlines all night at Bois D' Arc Lake with my Dad and Grandfather to catch catfish that we'd freeze and live off of for weeks. It was here I was baptized in the Garrett Memorial Baptist Church after accepting Jesus in a Vacation Bible School when I was ten years old. I truly went from Hope to Higher Ground. It was here that I met the girl who would become my wife of 41 years and give me three hildren and share what will soon be five grandchildren. We knew each other from elementary school and started dating our senior year of high school. It was here that I got a job at KXAR Radio at age 14 that would not only pay my way through school, but give me the opportunity to be mentored by Haskell Jones, the station manager and one of the few Republicans in the entire county. It was here that I became the first male in my family lineage to graduate from high school at the same campus that stands today and from here that I went on to college at Ouachita Baptist University. And it was here that I first ran for elected office when I ran for Student Council in Hope Junior High School. So it seems perfectly fitting that it would be here that I announce that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America. Eight years ago, a young, untested, inexperienced, and virtually unknown freshman Senator made great speeches about Hope and Change. But eight years later, our debt has more than doubled, America's leadership in the world has evaporated, and the country is more polarized than ever in my lifetime. 93 million Americans don't have jobs, and many who do have seen the full time job with benefits they once had become two part time jobs with no benefits. We were promised hope, but it was just talk, now we need the kind of change that really could get America from Hope to Higher Ground. Veterans who kept their promises to America and kept us free wait for months for our country to keep its promises to veterans for basic health care and assistance to cope with the scars of wars we sent them to fight. Our veterans should be getting the first fruits of our treasury not the leftovers. If I'm President, our veterans won't be left on the streets and in waiting rooms to rot, but will be treated with the dignity they have earned and deserve. When I meet men with an American Legion cap or one that says veteran, I try never to fail in saying thank you for giving me my freedom! But we owe them more than a pat on the back. We need to take them from Hope to higher ground. Washington is more dysfunctional than ever and has become so beholden to the donor class who fills the campaign coffers that it ignores the fact that one in four American families are paying more than half their income for housing. Home ownership is at the lowest level in decades and young people with heavy student debt aren't likely to afford their first home for a while. Our federal policies for affordable housing aren't designed to protect families, but to protect bureaucrats. A record number of people are enrolled in government operated help programs like food stamps, not because they want to be in poverty, but because they are part of the bottom earning 90% of American workers whose wages have been stagnant for 40 years. The war on poverty hasn't ended poverty; it's prolonged it. I don't judge the success of government by how many people are on assistance, but by how many people have good jobs and don't need government assistance. And we don't create good jobs for Americans by entering into unbalanced trade deals that forego Congressional scrutiny and looking the other way as the law is ignored so we can import low wage labor, undercut American workers, and drive wages lower than the Dead Sea. I governed in a state that was the most lopsided and partisan in the country no Republican Governor had more Democrats and fewer Republicans. I challenged the deeply entrenched political machine that ran this state. It was tough sledding, but I learned how to govern and how to lead, and even in that environment we passed 94 tax cuts, rebuilt our road system, saw dramatic improvements in student test scores, and fought the corruption of the good ol' boy system so working class people would be given a fair shake. And we saw family income increase by 50% during my tenure. Some propose that to save safety nets like Medicare and Social Security, we need to chop off the payouts for the people who have faithfully had their paychecks and pockets picked by the politicians promising that their money would be waiting for them when they were old and sick. You were forced to pay for Social Security and Medicare for 50 years. The government grabs money from our paychecks and says it will be waiting for us when we turn 65. If Congress wants to take away someone's retirement, let them end their own Congressional pensions not your Social Security. As President, I promise you will get what you paid for! How can anyone ever trust government again if they steal from us and lie to us? It didn't help when Congress took $700 Billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. And instead of helping families find affordable health care, we created a monster that forces us to buy coverage we don't want, don't need, and can't afford. And imagine members of Congress boasting they will fight to repeal Obamacare and then turning around and signing up for it. Real health care reform will focus on prevention and cures rather than costly intervention. Hope comes from finding cures for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's the same way we once lined up at the courthouse in the 50's and took our vaccines and eradicated polio. Cures could give real hope to families who hear a dreaded diagnosis and are sentenced to a slow and agonizing death. Alzheimer's Disease alone will cost well over $1 trillion by 2050. Focusing on cures instead of treatment saves money, lives, and families. I remember President Kennedy telling us we'd send a man to the moon and bring him home within the decade. President Kennedy didn't live to see that come true, but I did, and it made me believe America could do anything it set its mind to. As President, I'd launch a curative approach to health care and save money and lives not government programs. We face real threats from radical jihadism in the form of savage groups like ISIS and state terrorists like Iran, but we put more pressure on our ally Israel to cease building bedrooms for their families in Judea and Samaria than we do on Iran for building a bomb. Dealing with radicals who chant death to America and who fund bombs and rockets to murder civilians in Israel is nonsense. But when I hear the current President say he wants Christians to get off their high horse so we can make nice with radical jihadists, I wonder if he could watch a western from the fifties and be able to figure out who the good guys and bad guys are! As President, I promise you that we will no longer merely try to CONTAIN jihadism; we will CONQUER it! We will deal with jihadis just as we would deal with deadly snakes. And let there be no doubtIsrael will knowas will the worldthat we are their trusted friend, and the Ayatollahs of Iran will know that hell will freeze over before they ever get a nuclear weapon! And I will never, ever apologize for America! We face not only the threats from terrorism, but also the threat of new kinds of dangers, from a cyber war that could shut down major financial markets to threats of an electromagnetic pulse from an exploded device that could fry the electrical grid and take the country back to the Stone Age in a matter of minutes. Waiting until it happens is too late. But we've lost our way morally. We have witnessed the slaughter of over 55 million babies in the name of choice, and are now threatening the foundation of religious liberty by criminalizing Christianity in demanding that we abandon Biblical principles of natural marriage. Many of our politicians have surrendered to the false god of judicial supremacy, which would allow black robed and unelected judges the power to make law and enforce it upending the equality of our three branches of government and the separation of powers so very central to our Constitution. The Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and they can't overturn the laws of nature or of nature's God. Government in Washington is dysfunctional because it's become the roach motel people go in, but they never come out. As President I'll fight for Term limits on all 3 branches of government. That would help return us to the Founders dream that serving the public would be a temporary duty not a lucrative career with generous pensions and paychecks not available to the people who pay for them. And if someone is elected to an office, then give the taxpayers what they're paying for and what you said you wanted. If you live off the government payroll and want to run for an office other than the one you're elected to, then have the integrity and decency to resign the one you don't want and pursue the one you decided you'd rather have. As President, I would take seriously the 10th amendment and actually abide by it. Power was never intended to be so concentrated at the federal level. Our Constitution was explicitly clear about keeping the federal government small so it could focus on some simple things like providing a military and securing our borders. There are things being done at the federal level that should have been left in the hands of the states or even better, the families. There is no Constitutional authority to dictate education from the federal government. Why even have a federal department of education? It has flunked and it needs to be expelled. Education policy should be set by states, local school boards, and best of all, by the moms and dads of the children. Common sense tells us the best government is the most local and the most limited. We've supersized the federal bureaucracy, but we've downsized the military and left our borders open and uncontrolled. We need to address the immigration issue, but not with amnesty, but start by taking control of our own borders. But we ought to get on our knees every night and thank God we still live in a country people are trying to break into, instead of one they are trying to break out of. I'm running for President because I know that there is a difference between making a speech and making government accountable to the people who pay for it. You can't spend money you don't have or borrow money you can't afford to pay back. The federal government ought to live by the rules YOU have to live by and they should function under a balanced budget law like I had to every year I was a Governor. And I don't want to hear politicians talk about tinkering with the tax code and making little adjustments that still let powerful Washington interests pick the winners and losers. We can never create prosperity for working people, grow our economy out of the bottomless pit of debt, and move America back to the greatest economy on earth if we punish productivity and subsidize reckless irresponsibility. The man I met at a machine shop in New Hampshire told me of how he started working a double shift to help his daughter pay for grad school. He naturally figured that if he worked 16 hours a day instead of 8, he'd bring home twice the pay. But he found out that the money he worked for on that second shift put him in a new tax bracket and the government got more of it than he did. It's not that our tax system is punishing the richest people in America they can afford accountants and lawyers who will find a way to protect them. It's the people working for wages who can't get ahead if the government penalizes them for trying to do better. As President, I'll work to pass the Fair Tax, which would no longer penalize people's work, their savings, their investments, or their good stewardship. And it would be the end of big government bailouts and most importantly, we finally rid ourselves of the biggest bully in America, the IRS. The IRS would disappear and April 15 would be just another beautiful spring day. The struggle for many families isn't helped when the government solution is fighting over what the MINIMUM wage should be. It's a race to the bottom to figure out what the government determines the least you can make. We need to be promoting the MAXIMUM wage, which is set by the worker who is willing to avail himself or herself of training for a job that pays a maximum amount. We will never break the cycle of poverty by pushing people to their minimum wage, but by empowering them to reach their maximum wage. That is how we take people from Hope to Higher Ground! This country has to do three things to stay free: Feed itself, Fuel itself, and Fight for itself. Our farmers and ranchers provide our food and fiber and we need to keep them from being regulated out of business; we have enough energy resources under our feet to bring affordable energy to America and become the largest exporter so that Americans prosper in developing the energy and aren't impoverished by paying for it when produced by a Saudi Sheik or a Russian robber baron. And we need to be able to fight for ourselves by bringing manufacturing back to our communities where we make our own planes, tanks, bullets and bombs. The journey that begins in Hope today can lead this nation to Higher Ground, but I can't do it without people being my partnersmany who have never been involved in politics before now. I never have been and won't be the favorite candidate of those in the Washington to Wall Street corridor of power. I will be funded and fueled not by the billionaires, but by working people across America who will find out that $15 and $25 a month contributions can take us from Hope to Higher Ground. If you want to give a million dollars, please do it, but most can't. But I will ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren. I've walked away from my own income to do this, so I'm not asking you for a sacrifice I'm not willing to make. I don't have a global foundation or a taxpayer funded paycheck to live off of. I don't come from a family Dynasty, but a working family. I grew up blue collar and not blue blood. I ask you to join with me today not just so I can be President, but so we can preserve this great Republic and that someday YOUR children and grandchildren can still go from Hope to Higher Ground. I still remember when my Dad took me to the dedication of the newly constructed Bois D' Arc Lake, just a few miles from here, now named for Dr. Lester Sitzes, my best friend since 3rd grade. I was eight years old and he said, Son, the Governor is coming to dedicate the new lake and I'm going to take you there to hear him make a talk, because you might live your whole life and never get to meet a Governor in person. Had my Dad lived four months longer, he would have seen me do more than MEET a Governor. He would have seen me become the 44th Governor of my state. I always wished he could have been there and maybe spend the night in the Governor's Mansion, a place he never thought he'd get close to. I always wanted to feel that he did see that moment from the best seat in the house! And I hope he's able to watch in January of 2017, when that bashful little kid from the orange brick rent house on 2nd Street is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. And with your help and God's, we will make that journey from Hope to Higher Ground. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. It's great to be back in Iowa. It's great to be back here at this theater where believe it or not the sweater vest was born. I don't know if you know that or not. The first time I wore a sweater vest was when Citizens United hosted an event here with Mike Huckabee, and I guess I gave a good speech. So they really thought it was the sweater vest, not me. Typical. The press would never give me credit; they gave it to the vest. But It's great to be back and see so many friends and meet some new friends. I have been asked over and over and over one question since I have been here. I get it almost every person, same question over and over again. And I'm going to end the suspense, and I'm going to announce that Bella is doing great. Karen and I want to thank each and every one of you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, for all of your prayers through the election when we were dealing with Bella and her health issues and all of them since. We felt them, and as you'll find out soon, Karen and I are publishing a book about raising Bella. It's called "Bella's Gift," because she is. And we are publishing that; it's coming out in a couple of weeks. And you will find out how, how your prayers were answered so many times through that time and what it's like raising a child who has a severe disability and the challenges and the blessings it is. So I just want to let you know that Karen and I wrote the book jointly. We divided it evenly. We were going to write it together, and after an hour or so we figured that isn't probably going to work out too well. I have a very strongas you know, you know Karen. She's a very strong and principled woman. She has very strong opinions on things. And look, we dealt with this issue differently. And so we decided to divide the book evenly. She has 11 chapters. I have seven, and. Right. So look forward to that. I am obviously nostalgic here. Three years ago, after you got to know me and Karen and the kids, you heard me tell a story over at the Stoney Creek Inn in Johnston on Caucus Night, on a very wild and crazy Caucus Night I might add. And I shared a story about a young teenage boy; as a young teenage boy I knelt at the side of my grandfather's casket. He was a coal miner. I remember being at eye level and seeing just his hands, these strong, thick meaty hands, that dug coal until he was 72 years of age. And I remember sharing with you that as I sat there and I reflected on it, that those were the hands of an immigrant who came to this country after the first World War and brought his children later. That dug freedom for me. And it's a story that each of you, all Americans have, of somebody, your ancestor, who created the opportunity for you to be an American, to be a person who could pursue the American Dream, because you're standing on someone's shoulders. You know that wasn't what the campaign was always about. It became that, by going to, oh a few dozen Pizza Ranches in Iowa and several Meat and Threes. Now some of you don't know what Meat and Threes are, but if you're in South Carolina, you know what a Meat and Three is. And having town hall meetings and talking to the decent, hard working people of this country, the patriots who care deeply and are deeply concerned about this country and its direction right now. They're concerned about whether that American Dream, and that Dream was what? To work hard, sacrifice, to leave America and your family better than you found it, right? That is what the American Dream is. And a lot of people believe in America today that that Dream has slipped away. Now I can spend the rest of this speech easily detailing why President Obama and his middle class economics have failed, failed miserably. I can be haranguing on Obamacare and his tax increases and his government excess, all of those things. But what does that get us? How many people do we convince that they should vote for us by simply criticizing what the president does? That's their game. They won elections that way, they won the last election that way in 2012. It was divide, criticize, blame, not take responsibility for anything. That's their shtick. And what a horrible price they paid to win. This country, now we look at it, the 1% versus the 99%, black versus white, Anglo versus Hispanic, business versus labor. Americans feel the division and we're sick of it. We need to do better. We need to do better because America deserves better. They deserve a group, a party, a movement that is for policies that provide opportunity for every one to reach that American Dream and a message that unifies us. You're going to hear a lot of folks come in here today and you'll be privileged to a lot of people coming through Iowa. That's the blessing of Iowa. You will. But look for that message. Mike Lee is right. Look for that message that could bring us together. Because as good as it feels to hear the bad stuff, as good as it feels to beat up on the other side for the damage they've done to this country, and it's been substantial, I know through my own personal relationships that pointing the finger and condemning somebody doesn't win you a whole lot of arguments, and more importantly it doesn't bring us together. So today I want to share with you. I want to share with you a vision forward, a vision forward that can unite us, that I deeply believe in. It's a vision that says that we can restore the American Dream and it's not a different thing from what Republicans have stood for before. In fact it's additive. Because have been and we must be the party of growth and opportunity. We must be the party that says we want lower taxes, limited and responsible government, less regulation. We need to be the party that goes out and says that we're for fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets. All those things are right, but they're not enough. They're not enough. We need to be pro growth, but we also need to be pro worker. We need to be on the side of the American worker. Why? One of our favorite sayings I know that you hear Republicans say all the time, is a rising tide lifts all boats. And that is true unless your boat has a hole in it. Ladies and gentlemen, look at America today. Look at those who of the 70 percent of Americans don't have a college degree and many of them don't have a high school degree. Substance abuse, family breakdown, there's a lot of Americans who are out there who are seeking employment who want the American Dream, but they have holes in their boats. And so when you go out and talk about how we're going to raise the tide, how we're going to grow this economy and they see stagnant wages, declining median income and the lack of a ladder of advancement, they don't feel better; they feel like they're sinking deeper underneath the water. We have to be the party that says we understand what you're feeling. We understand what you're thinking. We understand the problems, and put forth a message that targets specifically not how we can help the economy but how we can help you and you and you. And we do it in a way that isn't divisive but it's unifying. How do we do it? It's actually pretty easy. It's actually pretty easy. First it starts with education. If you look at the 70 percent of Americans who don't have a college education, have limited skills, we need to make sure that we have opportunities for people to get those skills. We also need to look at why people are failing in schools and not getting those basic skills to be able to survive. Why? Because we have a top down government run education system that is failing our children. We need less Common Core and more common sense if we're going to make America a great and educated country We, What's the common sense? Talk to any teacher, and administrator and they'll tell you the same thing. The biggest key in determining the success of a child in school is the parents' involvement with that child in the school. So what does Common Core say? Stay out parents, we got this. The federal, the state, whatever it is, the folks, the elites, we're going to determine what's best for your child. When the schools and the elites should be saying we're failing and we need you parents to come in because we know by having you here your child's going to do better. The elites are doing just the opposite. We can fix, Look, I'm the, Karen and I home schooled our children. Is it hard? Thank you, thank her, not me; thank her. Was it harder? Sure, it's harder. Oh but what a blessing to be intimately involved in your children's education. That's the challenge. The path that we're going to lead forward here is not going to be easy. But it's going to be one that makes sense. It makes sense. That we need to restore and rebuild the American family. I don't know if you saw the statistic. Just this past week, America hit a milestone. For the first time in the history of our country more children are growing up without two parents than are growing up with two parents in the home. First time. Now 54 percent, and the number keeps dropping and keeps dropping and keeps dropping. And if you look at all the studies, what do all the studies say? It's about income inequality and the reason people are suffering. The Obama Administration wanted to make this a really big deal. The 1 percent and 99 percent. This was going to be the mantra for the last campaign in 2014. But it turned out that the biggest reason for income inequality is the breakdown of the family. What are we doing? Where do you hear us? You say you want to appeal to minorities and Hispanics. Where do you ever hear us talking about the family and the importance of strengthening the family, of doing things to stop government from getting in the way of people to get married and encouraging and supporting parents who have children, stay together and raise those children. That's not to be critical of anybody else, but it's to say that government shouldn't be an obstacle. When I was in Wisconsin during the campaign in 2012 I was told that if you were unmarried and had two children and you were making $15000 a year as a single mom, you got $38000 in welfare benefits. If you got married, you'd lose them all. Government is a barrier. We need to get government out of the way and help families be restored in America so children and they can have a better life and a better future. And if we're going to reform welfare then we need to reform all welfare and that means corporate welfare. We can't be the ones who are for bailouts, we can't be the ones who are for sweet deals for corporations if we're going to ask people to sacrifice and struggle and rise in our society. We've got to be for reducing both and eliminating both of those types of welfare. That's fair. You want to show that you're relating to the folks who are working in America, then we have to go out and prove it. We have to go out and show that we are for manufacturing jobs coming back to this country. In July of 2011 I went down to Winegard in Burlington and I launched my manufacturing initiative. That's what we talked about. All over this country. President Obama waved the red flag saying manufacturing jobs are gone. No, they're not. They're gone only because Washington makes manufacturers uncompetitive in the world market. If we can restore the manufacturing center of this country, if we can create the opportunity to make things so people with skills can learn the skills to work, to make things and to have quality jobs that pay good benefits, we've now created hope again. We've created a path forward for those who feel there is no path. We need to do that through energy, reducing energy prices and keeping them stable as well as construction. We need to be the party of the worker. Why? Well, it's good politics. You know, what percentage of American workers own their own business? Less than ten. So when we go out, as we have for many years and talk about entrepreneurs and businesses, we're talking about 10 percent of the public, and then we wonder why we don't win. We don't win because too many people don't think we care about them. We got to show them not just by saying we do, by having policies and a message where at they can see it and they can feel it in us. There's another issue, and this is one that Steve King has been I think impaled upon many times, but it's so important for American workers. I have a little quiz for you. Since 2000 there have been six million net new jobs created in America; six million net new jobs since 2000. How many of those net new jobs are held by people who were not born in this country? All of them. All of them. There are fewer Americans working today who were born in this country than there were in the year 2000 in spite of 17 million more in the workforce. And so when people say well we have to do something about the border and we have to do something about illegal immigration, they are right. We do. We have to secure the border. I was just down in Arizona talking to folks and it's horrendous the things that are going on on the border from national security perspective as well as what the president is doing. But we also have a problem with legal immigration. Legal immigration is at an all time high. There have been more people legally coming into this country in the last 20 years than any 20 year period in American history. We are approaching percentagewise the highest level of immigrants that we've ever had in America. Almost 14 percent now. It was 14 at the end of the great wave in 1920. There are more people not born in this country than have ever been in the history of this country, and it's affecting American workers. Why? Because the vast majority of the people coming into this country come in under chain immigration and they are unskilled. We all know there's not a huge growing number of jobs for unskilled laborers and as a result wages stagnate, median income comes down. We need to stand for an immigration policy that puts Americans first and American workers first. And this isn't an anti immigrant; I am for legal immigration. But in 1920 after 40 years of a great wave the Congress passed a bill because they were up to 14 percent of the workforce and it was having an effect on their labor markets. And so what the Congress did is pass the Immigration Act of 1921 and three years later 1924. And you know what they passed by? Unanimous in the House. One vote against the Senate on the first one and nine on the second. It was a bipartisan issue because even during the progressive era, which this was the tail end of, Republicans and Democrats put you first. Because for America to be a great country, a country that people want to come to, we have to be a strong country, and that means for everybody, skilled and unskilled worker alike. And so Steve is right, we need to step forward with an immigration policy, but we need to do so in the context of standing strong with American workers. Finally, there's an issue that in the 22 or 23 debates that were held in the last election cycle, I think there was one debate on this subject and maybe one or two questions at most during the debates and that was national security. Remember the war was over, Bin Laden was dead, Al-Qaeda was defeated, terrorism was gone. No well excuse me, extremism; can't say terrorism, extremism was gone. And what's happened since? We have seen the impact of isolationism. We have seen the impact of weakness on the part, and indecision on the part of an American president, an inexperienced, raw American president who had ideologies that didn't face reality. Ladies and gentlemen in this election cycle, we need to be looking for someone who has that experience, who has been tested and understands. I spent 16 years in the House and Senate, eight of those on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I heard Mike Lee said to be able to have someone who can stand up to their party when they're wrong. Twice I authored bills, once on Syria, to put sanctions on Syria. And President Bush opposed me for a year and a half, fought me for bringing the bill up, but eventually not only did he not fight me, he signed the bill. Because he saw eventually what I saw, which was Assad was a rogue regime that had to be constrained. Iran was next. We had an Iranian nuclear sanctions bill back in 2005 when most people thought Iran didn't even have a nuclear weapon and wasn't even trying. And the president, not this president but the last one, wanted to negotiate with Iran. I said don't negotiate. You can't negotiate with people who don't keep their promises. You can't negotiate with folks who have a theological end to their public policy. Again the administration opposed me. In fact there was a vote on the floor of the United States Senate and Condi Rice sent a letter, saying vote against Iranian sanctions on their nuclear program. I went forward with the vote of which Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden all voted no, against me, and six months later it passed unanimously. Leadership matters. Understanding the threat and being willing to have the courage to identify the threat. There's a lot of talk now about radical Islam and whether its extremism or terrorism. Let me tell you what it is. And I'll quote from a speech I gave in 2006 which I handed to President Bush saying he had to stop using the term terrorism because terrorism is a tactic; it is not an ideology. And if we're going to be honest with the American public and honest with the world and have the ability to confront this evil of radical Islam, then we have to name it what it is. That was 2006 and I laid that speech and I said, Mr. President, we're not going to win this war, no matter how many guns we have and how much we fight if Islam does not confront the cancer within and we don't identify that cancer and fight against it. Experience, knowledge, courage, on national security, the area where the president has the most purview, those are the things that are necessary. How do I know that? Well I was in Israel just a few months ago. In fact I took some Iowans. Bob vander Plaats came along. Simon Conway from WHO. Cary Gordon from Sioux City. And we met with senior Israeli officials. I had one of them pull me aside and say this to me. Senator, he said, please, please understand. You need to elect a president that is ready for war. That means a president who understands, understands all of the capabilities we have and understands the most important capability is the strength of America, in our military, in our diplomacy and yes, in the president of the United States. Ladies and gentlemen I don't envy your charge. I've been here many times as you know, and you had a tough time last time around. You made a very good decision by the way. Albeit somewhat delayed. You made a good decision and you're going to have to do that again. And I just want to encourage you. You do a great job. Iowans, as you see here from this crowd, the media notices. You take your job seriously and you should. The last time around everyone told you no, no, don't pick this person; this person has no chance. And you said well I think we're going to just vote for the best person that we believe has the best chance, not who Washington and New York thinks will have the best chance. You are serious people when this comes to this and this is a serious time. I just would say I agree with Chuck Grassley and Terry Branstad and all the others who say that it is well worth the mileage and the sleep to go to all 99 counties in Iowa. And if any one of these other guys wants a travelogue, I'll be happy to share it with them. Thank you very much and God Bless you. Thank you so much. What an amazing feeling to be up here with the folks who have made it possible for me. You know I would start with my family, and so I am. I just want to thank Karen, my sweetheart, all of my kids, for all of the sacrifices they made so we could be here today. I love you more than words. God bless you. Thank you so much. As you can see, we brought a little special gift up; she wanted to meet you. And that's our sweet daughter Bella, who just turned seven years old a couple of weeks ago. Bella also requested that she could go play during the speech. So we're going to let her go. Now I know this stage looks densely populated with our family, but we are actually still missing one member of our family and that is our son Daniel, who just last week, went to field training in the Air Force down in Alabama. Daniel, I am proud of you. Thank you. And, I also have to thank Penn United Technologies. We have disrupted this entire place for a week. God Bless you Bill, Becky, and everybody, thank you. And I just want to thank all of you for being here, for taking time out of your work and your schedule. And for many of you, there are people from 32 states that are here tonight. so I just want to thank you for being here. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a piece of coal. This is where my American story started. My grandfather, Pietro, was a coal miner who brought my Dad, 7 year old Aldo, from fascist Italy. Like millions of other Americans, he didn't come for this. He came for freedom. My dad grew up in a coal town, actually a company town, during the Depression, without indoor plumbing. It took a war to get him out of the coal town, off to the Pacific, then the GI Bill to college. And then to a Veterans Hospital in West Virginia. It's there he met a wonderful nurse, Catherine Dughi, who is my mom. Mom is 96. She shouldn't be here today, but I just want to say hello to my mom, who I know is watching. They took me on a voyage at seven years of age from West Virginia to Butler, Pennsylvania. We lived on the VA post in World War II government apartments surrounded by our nation's veterans. Most of my friends though, their dads worked in the mills and the mines. They got off shift and coached us in sports and in life. They were the generation of God fearing people who built this country and at the same time, were the foundation of the country. In the late 70's, like many of you, we saw the economic devastation here in Southwestern Pennsylvania and across this country, particularly in manufacturing, as a result of the excesses and indifference of big labor, big government, and yes, big business. Here in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the epicenter, we lost over 100000 jobs in what seemed to be overnight. That has to and did leave a mark on all of us. Afterwards, big government and big business told our workers that times have changed, American workers could no longer compete with low foreign wages and that those jobs were gone forever. Well, what about those politicians? For all those years, what did they do? What did they do for communities across this area and across this country and in small town America? They had no plan, and they provided no hope. And to that, I say, no longer. As Middle America is hollowing out, we can't sit idly by as big government politicians make it harder for our workers and then turn around and blame them for losing jobs overseas. Working families don't need another President tied to big government or big money. And today is the day, today is the day we are going to begin to fight back. I am proud to stand here among you and for you, the American workers who have sacrificed so much, to announce that I am running for President of the United States. I'll offer a bold vision for America, one that's clear and conservative, that has plans to reform and has a proven track record that I have in my time in service. Step one in taking back America, step one, let's scrap the corrupt federal tax code and the IRS that goes with it. It's time to give America a simple, fair, flat tax. It will create millions of good paying jobs. It will rebuild our factories, and it will increase take home pay for workers in America. Powered by the shale revolution and the renewable revolution. Powered by those two revolutions, we have regained the title of the world leader in energy production. With low cost energy and our bold plan, I promise you we will regain the title of a leader in world manufacturing. And that's not all. We will shrink government, we will reduce spending, we will revoke every executive order and regulation, yeah. We will revoke every executive order and regulation that costs American jobs. From day one, we will work to bring back America and put Americans back to work. American workers deserve a shot at these jobs. Over the last 20 years, we've brought into this country, legally and illegally, 35 million mostly unskilled workers. And the result, over that same period of time, workers' wages have flat lined. Hillary Clinton and big business, they have called for a massive influx in unskilled labor. Business does it because they want to control costs. Hillary does it, well, she just wants votes. Their priorities are profits and power. My priority is you, the American worker. You don't believe me, don't take my word for it. Yesterday, the largest pro worker immigration group just published a survey that showed that only one candidate got an "A" standing behind American workers, and he's standing here today. We can create jobs, but as we've all seen America can't succeed unless we strengthen the first economy, the American family. It's time we have a President who sees the struggle of working families in America not as an opportunity to divide us along race or class, but as a chance to unite us around the ideal that every child in America deserves her birthright, to be raised by her parents in a healthy home. Stronger families and more jobs will result in better schools. But our children, well, they deserve and education customized, customized, to maximize their potential. The first step in the process is joining me to drive a stake in the heart of Common Core. I can't forget about the other people that I grew up with out at the VA in Butler, our wounded warriors. I saw the price of freedom. I saw the cost of failed political leadership. The Obama Clinton team, they don't understand that peace comes through strength. But, when I see our heroic veterans dying, waiting in line at the VA, because these very same leaders don't care enough to give them what they've earned, the best medical care in the world., I say join me, take back America, and help these veterans. As you've seen, Commander in Chief is not an entry level position. And the White House is the last place for on the job training. It's critical that both our allies and our friends know what to expect from our next President. Last month, i was featured in an online magazine. That's usually a good thing. But in this case, the online magazine was the magazine of the Islamic state, ISIS. Under the headline, under the headline "in the words of our enemy," was my picture and a quote. "After 12 years of legislating and warning about the gathering storm of radical Islam, they know who I am and I know who they are." In that article, I described who they are and how to defeat them. And ladies and gentlemen, if I'm the next President, we will defeat them. Finally, we must take back America from those who seek to deny us our god given rights of life and liberty. As President, I will stand for the principle that every life matters, the poor, the disabled, and the unborn. I will also fight for the freedom for you to believe what you are called to believe, not just in your places of worship, but outside of your places of worship too. Karen and I have learned a lot in our life and if there's one thing we've learned, man is limited and God is not. There is much we can do. But first, we need to pray for the same kind of great awakening that inspired and provided our founding to come to this country to heal our land. Now if you watch any of these announcements here coming up this week, you are going to see a lot of folks saying what they're going to do. That's what they do. But how do you know who to trust? Well, you look at their record. I went to Washington and said I was going to fight corruption. And I delivered. I went to end welfare, to reduce poverty, and to put people back to work. And I delivered. I went to give patients control over their health care through Health Saving Accounts. And I delivered. I went to end partial birth abortion. And I delivered. I went to impose sanctions on Syria and Iran to protect the state of Israel and this country. And I delivered. And I went to cut taxes and promised never to raise them. And I delivered. Our record of standing for you and standing up against big government is clear. 92% conservative voting record. How does someone like that get elected in the Mon Valley of Pittsburgh, in one of the most Democratic areas of the state? How does someone with a conservative voting record get elected twice to the state of Pennsylvania, where there's over a million more registered Democrats than Republicans? Because I stood for you and against big government in Washington DC. Fighting in those races, both here in Southwestern Pennsylvania and across Pennsylvania, I know what it's like to be an underdog. Four years ago, well, no one gave us much of a chance. But we won 11 states. We got four million votes. And it's not just because I stood for something. It's because I stood for someone, the American worker. I promised then as I promise you now, I will take money and power out of Washington and put it back where our Constitution says it belongs, in the people who earned it. The last race, we changed the debate. This race, with your help, and God's Grace, we can change this nation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Gill. Thank you so much for being here. You know, I've been here to every single Value Voter Summit. And, you know, one of the things, I was in Iowa the other day, in Osceola, Iowa. Of course, all of you have been there, right? And I was introduced by Chuck Grassley. And Chuck got up and sort of hemmed and hawed a little bit about what to say. And he said, well, let me just say this: The one thing I can say about Rick Santorum is I've known him for 20 years and he hasn't changed a bit. You know, I think that's about as high a compliment as you can get in this town of Washington, DC, right? We just had someone step down today who, in my opinion, changed a bit and it's probably time for him to have stepped down to start a new chapter here in Washington, DC I come here every year and I talk to you to thank you, to thank you for standing up and bringing to this city the issues that are at the core of the problems in this country. America is never going to be a great country if we're a country that kills our children in the womb, ever. We are never going to be blessed by God if we're a country that kills our children in the womb. We are never going to be a great country if we allow for the destruction of the American family that's what's happened over the past 50 years. And thank you for coming here and for standing for truth, standing for what you know is right and best for this country. You know, we have a lot of candidates for president who will come up here on stage. And they'll rile you up and talk to you about all the things that they're going to do. But here's the best way to determine whether you can trust the person who's coming before you. Look at their record. Look at what they've accomplished. Look at what they've fought for. Look at what they have paid a price for. I came to Washington, DC, and I'll have to be honest with you, I wasn't a pro, I was pro life, but I wasn't' a pro life warrior. It was only in a situation that's similar to what's happening here with Planned Parenthood, when we were made aware of this issue called partial birth abortion, this horrific procedure. I know about this procedure. I was on CNN the other day and we were talking about, I was talking with Chris Cuomo, not always a fun, necessarily, thing to do. And we were talking about the Planned Parenthood videos, and I said: Not only should we defund Planned Parenthood, we should be prosecuting Planned Parenthood. And he got very upset with me. Said, what do you mean? He said, what laws have they broken? I said, well, the procedures that we saw described in these videos I know very well, because they were partial birth abortions. And he says, well, OK, but, you know, how do you know that that's against the law? I said, because I wrote the law. I know that it's against the law. We have been fighting these battles, I have been standing in the forefront for year after year after year fighting the battles on life. And we see right now that we have people in Congress, we have people even in the leadership of our party who, when given the opportunity to raise up an issue and focus America's attention on the horror of abortion, they retreat and refuse to fight. They think they can't win the battle, so they give up before it's even fought. Ladies and gentleman, there are a lot of people going to come up here and ask you for your support, and they're going to tell you that they're with you. Here's what I would say, have you been disappointed enough by people who promise you things and don't deliver? Have you seen folks that you thought were with you, and then you realize when it got tough they weren't willing to get into the trenches and fight? And here's what I would say. You know one person in this race who is always willing to fight for live, always willing to fight for the family. Every major piece of pro life legislation that's passed in the last 20 years I was the author of and I led the fight on the floor of the Senate. And I didn't come from a safe state, , I didn't come from a safe state where you can easily vote that way, much less lead that way. Well, a lot of people come up here and tell you they're for marriage, but you know what? Ten of the 14 Republican candidates have said this: Oh, well, it's the law of the land. It's time to move on. Really? We have a United States Supreme Court that, according to several of the justice on that court in the dissent, acted unconstitutionally. Oh, it's time to move on when the court acts unconstitutionally? We have a United States Supreme Court who has directly assaulted the First Amendment of our Constitution. And 10 of the 14 candidates say, oh, it's time to move on. We have a United States Supreme Court that says marriage has nothing to do with children, , that marriage is about adults. And 10 out of the 14 Republican candidates say it's time to move on. If you're not willing to fight for the Constitution, for the First Amendment, and for the American family, why are you running for president as a Republican? Tell you a little story. Four years ago I was in one of these meetings with all these big donors in New York. And they had gone through all the Republican candidates, I was the last one that they had. And I sat down with them and they were interviewing me like they had all the other Republican candidates. And they asked me a question on abortion. I answered it. They asked a second question on abortion. I answered it. Then they asked a third question on abortion. I said, wait a minute. I said, you've had all the other Republican candidates up here. I said, why are you asking me, I mean, excuse me, have you asked any of the other candidates about abortion? Silence. And one of them said, no. I said, well, wait a minute. They all have the same positions I do. They all say they're pro life. I said, but you asked not any of them one question, you've asked me three? I said, why are you asking me questions and not them? And the answer was, because we know you mean it. You want a fighter you can trust, then go with a fighter you trusted, who was there. On marriage, I hear a lot of people talk about marriage now. I said, four of the Republicans have said they're going to fight for marriage. But when I was in the United States Senate, I stepped out on the issue of marriage way before anybody else, even before they started to approve gay marriages in the courts. I criticized the Supreme Court. I said we needed to pass a federal marriage amendment. Republicans and Democrats alike said, called me all sorts of names. You're just trying to pick on these people. We don't need to deal with this. There's no issue here. There's no problem here. I said, we'll have gay marriage within 10 years. I said this 11 years ago and I was wrong. I missed by a year. But we drafted an amendment to the Constitution and I forced a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. And let me tell you, in the rooms outside of the view of the public, I was getting beaten up. Why are you forcing us to vote on this thing? We're going to look like haters and bigots. So all these folks who come here, some of them today who stood here and talked about how they're for you, behind closed doors were kicking my, well, you know. We forced that vote. And guess what? It's the only vote that's ever been taken. When I left, so did the effort to make marriage between one man and one woman in the Congress. You want someone who's going to fight for you? Look at their track record. Look what they fought for. Look what they lost over. And look how successful they are. You want someone you can trust, like you could trust Ronald Reagan in 1980 that when he came into office he was going to stand up against the evil of communism and defeat them? Then look at their record. The greatest threat to a country today overseas is a threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Ten years ago, you know, I have a lot of people come up here and say, we need to name the enemy. We need to go after who the enemy is. I encourage you to go back and look at a speech I gave 10 year ago at the National Press Club, in which I said: We need to identify the enemy and call them who they are. And I didn't just give speeches. Iran, we put nuclear sanctions on Iran 12 years ago. I authored that bill that put the nuclear sanctions on Iran. And for 12 years, I've been talking here in this country, on the floor of the Senate, across this country afterwards, talking about the threat of not just radical Islam but, in the case of Iran, what I apocalyptic Islam, Islam that is about bringing about the end of the world, because that's what they believe. How many times does America have to pay the lesson of not listening to what desperates say they want to do and not believing them? We have a regime in Iran that says they want to bring about the end of the world to bring about their return of their savior, called the Mahdi. And we just gave them the opportunity to have a nuclear weapon. That, ladies and gentlemen, is suicidal. And that, ladies and gentlemen, will not happen if you elect me president of the United States. Day one, day one, I know all these people say, oh, you can't tear this up and you can't do this. Let me tell you what you can do. When the president of the United States doesn't have the guts to bring a deal to the Congress for ratification it's his deal, not our deal, and it won't be our deal when I become president of the United States. I will tell the Iranians simply this, and they know I mean it. I wrote an op ed last year about this negotiation, and the Iranian government responded to it. They know who I am. Last year, excuse me, in April of this year, I was in ISIS Magazine. It was the centerfold. It was a nice picture, nicer than I usually get in most of the mainstream media around you; tells you how far gone they are. And next to it was a quote underneath the headline in the words of our enemies was my picture and my quote defining, describing who they were. I know who they are and they know who I am. No other presidential candidate has been in ISIS Magazine. We can't risk any misperception. When the next president raises his hand, our enemies have to know who they're dealing with and our friends have to know who they're dealing with. I will stand with Israel. I will stand with our allies. And I will defeat radical Islam. Ladies and gentlemen, if we're going to win this election we have to take actually some of the words of what Pope Francis was talking about yesterday. He was talking about the poor, the workers, the people who are being left behind in society. All of the things he talks about is all focused on the idea that there's an unequal distribution. There's environmentalism that is, environmental waste that's hurting the poor. And here in America we see the middle of America hollowing out. I announced from a factory floor in western Pennsylvania. The reason I did was because I know who the Republican Party is. I know who the conservative movement is in this country. They're not Wall Street. They're not people who live in the big homes in the Hamptons. They don't vote for us anymore. Who votes for us are people who love this country, who want an opportunity to rise, who believe in faith and family and opportunity, and are looking for a party. They're looking for a movement who cares and talks about them. And ladies and gentlemen, let's just be honest. We haven't done a very good job of that. And as a result, if you look at the last election, millions of Americans who didn't want to vote for Barack Obama just stayed home in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan and all the states where, if we want to win this presidency, we've got to. We've got to attract those votes. That's why I announced from a factory floor and said that I would pledge to make America the number one manufacturer in the world again. You want to solve global warming? Get all those jobs from China that pollute unlimitedly. Bring them back to America, where we have cleaner energy and clean things, and we will create jobs and reduce global climate. And another way that we need to put this framework of being strong for American workers is on immigration. When you think of the word immigration, most people, when you hear the word immigration, you think, oh, well, I think of that illegal person, and what are we going to do about them? Why? Because many Republicans and all Democrats have decided that's how we should frame this debate. The debate should be framed about what we're going to do about illegal immigrants in this country instead of what every other policy debate in America is framed around. You finish this sentence. Every policy we pass in America should be in the best interest of — There you go. But not immigration. Immigration is about the people who broke the law, not the people who are obeying the law. Why do we let them do this, ladies and gentlemen? Why do we even have our candidates up here let them do this? A majority of the people in this race, ladies and gentlemen, are not good on the issue of immigration. Oh, they'll talk about how tough they're going to be; secure the border. Look, let's just, let's just do a given. Everybody's for securing the border. But that's not it. That's a start. But as long as you continue to have the magnets here, the border is only part of your problem. And the magnet is, number one, the belief that there's going to be amnesty. Now, you have a lot of people get up here and talk about how tough they are. But they actually support amnesty. The speaker who was just here before me running for president, he'll tell you how tough he is. But when he was in the Senate, he's in the Senate, he offered an amendment to allow people to stay in this country indefinitely. Now, for me that's amnesty. We have to have a policy that says that we are going to make sure that everyone who broke the law in this country is, in an orderly fashion, returned to their country of origin and have to come in like everybody else in this country, legally. And for those who say it can't be done, half of the illegal immigrants in this country are here on visa overstays. We know who they are. We know where they are. All we have to do is what we aren't doing right now, which is tell them to go home and return to their country of origin. But it's not just illegal immigration. The place which is really harming the American worker, 90 percent, 70 to 90 percent of the workers who come to this country, both legally and illegally, are wage earners. That's why you see the angst in America about this issue of immigration. That's why it's caught on so much. Why? Because people realize that when you bring in 35 million people over the last 20 years, more than any other 20 year period in American history, and the vast majority of them are wage earners, fairly low skilled, that it's going to have an impact on American wage earners. And that's why they're frustrated. And they don't see either political party talking about them. And it's not just illegal. It's both legal and illegal. We're bringing in more legal immigrants in this country than ever in the history of our country, over a million a year. There's only one candidate in this race who suggested that we eliminate a couple of worker, a couple of immigration categories and reduce the number of immigrations by 25 percent. Focus on making sure that we create a better opportunity for working men and women to get good paying wages. Why? Because in the last 20 year period of time wages have gone up less than a nickel an hour per year. American workers know. American workers know that the policies of this country, the immigration policies, are hurting. And no one has talked about it yet. Almost every single person in this race is for more legal immigration. Some want to double it, including the senators who spoke here this morning. Some want to take some categories and increase them by 500 percent, like some of the senators who spoke here this morning. Ladies and gentlemen, there are big differences. You have to make a decision here, and it's a tough one. Who are you going to support? Who are you going to trust? Who has the right vision to be able to capture the voters that we need in order to win? When I was a little girl my mother who was my Sunday school teacher that year gave me and the rest of her Sunday school class a little plaque, and it said: What you are is God's gift to you. What you make it yourself is your gift to God. I didn't feel very gifted as a child, but I went on to college and I graduated with a degree in medieval history and philosophy. That's right all dressed up and nowhere to go. So with apologies to every lawyer here, I went off to law school. I hated it. I quit after a single semester. And so to earn a living I went back to doing full time what I had done part time to put myself through school. I was a secretary, and I was hired by a little nine person real estate firm to type and file and answer the phones. I have traveled and lived all over the world and I know that is still true in 2015 that it is only in the United States of America that a young woman can start as a secretary and become the chief executive officer of the largest technology company in the world. That is only possible in the United States of America because you see our founders knew what my mother taught me. All of us have god given gifts. Everyone has potential and our founders believed that here everyone has the right to fulfil their potential. Now I know how proud all of you were the other night to see your Senator Joni Ernst stand up and deliver the response to President Obama's State of the Union. Immediately after her response, EMILY's Listthe pro abortion women's groupEmily's List described Senator Ernst, a mother, a soldier, a sitting Senator as window dressing. Let us talk please about who is waging a war on women. The next morning, the very next morning Valerie Jarrett was on TV and she was talking about equal pay for equal work. I was on the same program and I asked Ms. Jarrett why there was a wage gap between men and women in President Obama's White House as measured by the very numbers that he has used to politicize the issue. And I asked her further why, if she was so concerned about equal pay for equal work, why the White House was not tackling the seniority system, which is in place in every federal government bureaucracy and every union shop. The seniority system which does not reward performance or merit or hard work, but rewards instead time in grade; the seniority system which disadvantages women. It is this hypocrisy, the hypocrisy of liberals that enrages me most. While President Obama urges us in his State of the Union to invest in infrastructure, he is unwilling still to support the Keystone XL pipeline. And while the Administration cheers when seven million people sign up for Obamacare, they ignore completely that more than that have lost their coverage or no longer have as good coverage as they once had. Liberals will decry crony capitalism but then they pile on the rules and the regs in Dodd Frank and the result as we know is that 10 banks too big to fail have become five banks too big to fail, and meanwhile community banksthe places where family owned businesses and families and small business owners get their creditcommunity banks are struggling. They are struggling because community banks, like small and family owned businesses, aren't big enough, aren't powerful enough to hire all the accountants and the lawyers and the lobbyists to understand all these rules and regs or to influence them. Liberals call us the party of big business, but then they continue to increase the burden and the complexity of taxes and regulations until only the big and the powerful and the wealthy and the well connected can survive. I ran a big business. I didn't like the regs, but I could handle them. I could hire accountants and lawyers. That little nine person firm that I started out in. They can't handle it And so now for the first time in US history we are destroying more small businesses then we are forming and that is terrible. Because when small business is crushed, and it is being crushed all across this country by big government. Small business is the engine of economic growth of this country. It creates two thirds of the new jobs and employs half our people. Small business is being crushed because only big business can handle big government. I once lived in the state of California; my husband and I moved back home to Virginia three years ago. But in the state of California, that's a state as you well know where liberals have been in charge for a very long time. And the result, the highest poverty rates in the country. Income inequality is soaring. The devastation and exodus of the middle class. The worst business climate in the nation. And in California liberals expend enormous energy to protect frogs and fish and yes even flies. And it is on the issue of life that the hypocrisy of liberals is at its most breathtaking. Liberals believe that flies are worth protecting, but the life of an unborn child is not. The platform of the Democratic Party, the platform of the Democratic Party asserts the right to an abortion it any point in a pregnancy for any reason. And there are now people in the Democratic Party pushing to allow these abortions to be performed by non doctors. Barbara Boxer once commented that a life is only a life when it leaves the hospital. We know that science supports those of us who believe in the sanctity of life. When I married my husband Frank thirty years ago, I learned that his mother had been told to abort him because her life was in danger. But she was a woman of deep faith and great courage and so she bore him. She spent a year in the hospital after his birth. But her son, my husband, was the joy of her life and he is the rock of mine. And I have thought very often how different my life would have been if my mother in law had made a different choice. A woman, any woman, who faces a difficult choice or a prenatal diagnosis, this woman deserves our empathy and our support, never our judgment or our condemnation. She knows she will face difficulty and struggle, but none of us can predict the future. None of us can predict the struggles we are going to face. I know this, I know this, having watched our younger daughter Lori consumed by the demons of addiction which ultimately took her life. I know from my own battle with cancer that sometimes the greatest blessings in life come from times of struggle, and that the quality of a life is measured in love and in moments of grace and in positive contribution. I know that everyone has god given gifts and every life has potential. We know what separates liberals from conservatives. We know as conservatives that no one of us is better than any other one of us. Liberals don't believe that; liberals actually think that some are better than others, some are smarter than others, and so some are gonna have to take care of others or decide for others. We know, we know that work, work brings dignity and family brings purpose and faith brings meaning to our lives. We know. We know that every person has the capacity, has the desire to live a life of dignity and purpose and meaning. And yet despite these clear differences we get frustrated when these clear differences don't seem to translate into a different direction. Government has gotten bigger under Obama that is true. But government has grown year after year after year under both Republicans and Democrats for fifty years I serve as the chairman of a Christian based organization called Opportunity International. We have lent over six billion dollars to people in desperate poverty so that they could build better lives for themselves and their families starting with loans of a hundred and fifty dollars. Today I can deliver al loan to a woman in Malawi over a cell phone and yet a veteran returning from the battlefield with grievous wounds, a veteran must spend months filling out paperwork and then spend many more months waiting for a bureaucrat to check that paperwork and determine that this veteran has, deserves the benefits that they've already earned. And then they have to wait months more to be treated. We can't tinker around the edges of this problem anymore, but knowing that that problem has existed for decades and that's just one of the problems of our government. The Veterans Administration has been a problem for decades, knowing that these problems have existed for all this time. The sad truth is that legislators from both parties declared victory, not when they were able to guarantee a veteran the care that they have earned; they declared victory when they did something that they should have done a long time ago. They passed a bill allowing senior VA executives to be fired if they weren't doing their jobs. Really, really is this the best we can do? The majority of Americans and the majority of women to agree that abortion after five months for any reason at all is extreme and yet politics apparently intervened to prevent the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act from being brought to the floor for a vote. This is disappointing because what it says is that once again politics has triumphed over principle and expediency has triumphed over courage. This is not leadership of the House. I am reminded, I am reminded of the difference between management and leadership. Between managers and leaders. You see managers do the best they can within existing constraints and conditions, within the system. Leaders change constraint and conditions. Leaders see possibilities, and leaders mobilize others to seize possibilities. Leaders do not accept what is broken simply because it has always been that way. You know in every profession there's a hazard, there's a hazard that you're so consumed by your profession that you don't see anything else and so you start to lose perspective; your judgment is clouded. You cannot see the forest for this trees. You cannot see the principle for the politics. You cannot recognize the dysfunction all around you. In business people can become obsessed, for example, with making the quarterly numbers and maybe fail in that environment to see the long term investments that need to be made or they violate ethics or the law to make the numbers. In politics, people can become obsessed with the back and forth, with the tactical advantage, with the vote in front of them, with the press coverage about them. They fail to see the principle at stake or what is truly broken in our system. People who have been in and around government and politics for their entire lives may no longer be able to see the truth. Our government must be fundamentally reformed. The system has to be changed. Our politics can no longer tinker on the edges, because you see and you know this, the bureaucratic monster that our government has become is not simply inefficient or ineffective or corrupt. The truth now is that our government's size, its complexity, its cost and its power over our lives now work against the interests of the people. The potential of America is being crushed by the weight of government of America. Only citizens, only citizens like you and me can see what must be done, and this will take courage and common sense. It will take character and it will take commitment. Ours was always intended to be a citizen government. Our founders actually never envisioned a professional political class. They envisioned that people, that leaders would emerge from agriculture or commerce and would serve their nation when she called them to do so. To accomplish fundamental reform will take an understanding of the technology that is driving this century and changing our world. It will require an understanding how the economy actually works. It will require an understanding, a knowledge of how bureaucracies function and how real change can be accomplished. Fundamental reform will take a return to the values that have always been the bedrock of this nation. We must understand our role in the world, which is to lead, and the nature of our allies and especially the nature of our adversaries. Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds and thousands of miles around the globe, but unlike her I've actually accomplished something. You see Mrs. Clinton, flying is not an accomplishment, it is an activity. I have met Vladimir Putin and I know that it takes far more than a gimmicky red reset button to halt his ambition. Having done business in over 80 countries, having served as the chairman of the External Advisory Board at the Central Intelligence Agency for several years, I know that China and North Korea and Russia are state sponsors of cyber warfare. I know that China has a strategy to steal our intellectual property I know Bibi Netanyahu, and I know that when he warns us that Iran is a threat to our nation and to his own that we must listen. And unlike Hillary Clinton I know what difference it makes that our American ambassador and three other brave Americans were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11 in Libya. And apparently unlike Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama I know our response must be more forceful than the arrest of a single individual one year later. I am a conservative because after a lifetime of experience in all kinds of places and in all kinds of environments, I still know that our principles work better to unlock the potential in others, and I also know that this is the highest calling of leadership. I have had the great privilege to travel all across this nation and all across the state of Iowa and I sense a deep disquiet. Americans fear we are losing something and they know we are missing something. We fear we are losing the essence of who we are, we fear we are losing that uniquely American sense of limitless possibility for ourselves, for our children, for our grandchildren. But all of our nation's wounds are self inflicted. All of our problems can be solved. Every American can leave a live a life of dignity and purpose and meaning. We have everything we need to make this time the greatest time in America's history. What is required now is citizenship and leadership and so let us together rise to meet the challenges that confront us. Let us together truly reform our government and our politics Let us together restore the promise of this, the greatest nation the world has ever known. Thank you for having me here tonight. In his farewell address, President Reagan said: Don't be afraid to see what you see. I have always believed the role of a leader is to see the truth, speak the truth and act on the truth. I am here tonight to speak about what I see and to describe how I am prepared to act. I see a world in dire need of American leadership. I see President Obama and Secretary Clinton always speaking in terms of ambivalence and shades of gray, offering false choices and raising the shadow of doubt about our will to lead. The next President of the United States must reestablish our leadership—she must speak with clarity, accept that some things are black and white and act with courage. She must be prepared to challenge the status quo and change the way things are—whether in Washington or around the world. The world is a more tragic and dangerous place when America is not leading. Terrorists are on the march. Nearly 45000 people are driven from their homes each day. Last week, four marines and a Navy officer were murdered here at home by a radicalized terrorist. Human trafficking is on the rise. Christians across the globe are persecuted. Women are denied the most basic rights. Girls live in fear of being mutilated, raped, or bought and sold as sex slaves. We tweet save our girls, but Boko Haram continues on a murderous rampage of kidnapping, pillaging and horrors we can barely imagine. President Obama has richly rewarded the bad behavior of Cuba, Russia, Syria, Iran and China, and Mrs. Clinton has signaled her approval. It is really quite simple. When you reward bad behavior, you get more of it. President Obama has negotiated a deal with an Iran that has repeatedly violated agreements, killed and wounded thousands of Americans, and flat out lied about every nuclear facility they have built over the last three decades. He has negotiated with a state that refuses to release American prisoners. And for what? Yesterday we learned that the Iranian regime has decided that in fact inspectors will have no access to their military facilities—never mind 24 days' notice, just no access. Period. Perhaps this is the content of the secret deal between Iran and the IAEA? In Russia, Secretary Clinton told us that she could reset our relationship there—a policy that has utterly failed. I've met Vladimir Putin. He craves power. He will not be stopped by a gimmicky red button. Putin's ambition continues to grow, unchecked. When President Obama warned Assad not to cross a red line, Assad took this as an invitation, not an admonition. This administration's blind eye to aggression has become a black eye for America. When we do not stand with our allies nor confront our adversaries, our friends lose courage and our enemies press forward. I know you are outraged. Sick of a professional political class that lectures and harangues —and never actually says anything at all. You know empty promises and bumper sticker rhetoric solve nothing. For too long we have had too many speeches and too few results. The American people deserve an honest leader. Who will own up to the difficulties of the job in front of her—and who has a track record of leadership, accomplishment, and challenging the status quo. As you are all aware, I am not a member of the professional political class. But I do have extensive national security and foreign policy experience. I have served as the Chairman of the CIA's External Advisory Board and I have advised Secretaries of State and Defense as well as the NSA and Department of Homeland Security. I have done so with the highest civilian security clearances. I have led a company doing business in 170 countries. I have advised governments and done charitable work in their nations. I have met with and gotten to know many leaders around the world. They know me, respect me and, most importantly, they trust me as a woman of action and of my word. As President, I will not wait until things have reached the crisis level. And I will not shy away from the most important challenges facing our world today. Because without American leadership, we face two choices: regional hegemons who challenge America or global chaos. Here's what I will do as Commander in Chief. First, we must have the strongest military on the face of the planet and everyone has to know it. This will take both an investment in our military and a reform of the Defense Department. We must fix what's called the tooth to tail ratios. Tooth to tail ratios are measured regularly in the Defense Department. Tooth—tip of the spear, our fighting men and women, the weapons systems and the technology they require to fight and win. Tail, bureaucracy—much too large for what we need to defend our nation. In fact, our tooth to tail ratios are as bad right now as they have ever been. So it's not just throwing more money at the problem. It's investing the money as well as our intellect and our imagination in the right places—tooth—and reducing the amount spent on a bureaucracy in need of reform— tail. President Obama announces the lay off of 40000 troops in response to sequester cuts. Professional politicians have engaged in such brinksmanship which brought us the sequester. While everyone decries it, no one has fixed it. We must reinvest in our military. The next President of the United States, like Ronald Reagan, will need to rebuild our military capability. Morale of our armed forces is low. We need a Commander in Chief who will unabashedly celebrate their honor, courage, and sacrifice. I was recently on the phone with Leif Babin, a decorated former Navy SEAL who has received a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart. We talked about the battle of Ramadi and what our men and women are capable of. We have the bravest and strongest fighting force the world has ever seen. It's time we act like it. They deserve a Commander in Chief with a strategy for victory over there and they deserve a government that fulfills its promises when they get home. And so we must care for those who have served us. We need to overhaul the VA from top to bottom. It is a stain on our nation's honor. Technology can do amazing things but our veterans are still waiting far too long for the benefits they earned. And we haven't heard a lot from the political class in Washington about the VA since it dropped out of the headlines, but I can assure you it is still broken. And I will assure you that the political class in Washington that hasn't fixed it for decades, isn't going to fix it unless we elect someone who knows how to challenge the status quo and change bureaucracies. On my first day in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls. The first will be to my friend Bibi Netanyahu. I will reassure him that the United States will always stand with the State of Israel. My second call will be to the Supreme Leader of Iran. He might not take the call, but he will get the message. I will tell him: new deal. Unless and until Iran opens itself to full and unfettered inspections of all nuclear and military facilities, we are going to make it very hard for Iran to move money around the global financial system. US companies should not be profiting off of this murderous regime. The next President of the United States will have a lot to do with whether Apple and McDonald's are doing business in Tehran. These two calls are also signals that the United States is back in the leadership business. I will not call Vladimir Putin. We have talked way too much to him. But he too will get the message. We must rebuild our Sixth Fleet. We must conduct military exercises in the Baltic States. President Obama unilaterally and inexplicably withdrew our missile defense programs in Poland—I will rebuild them. We learn more about atrocities committed by ISIS every day. Christians are being crucified. Children are used as body shields for jihadi soldiers. Muslims are killed for being the wrong type of Muslim. Women and girls are subject to systematic rape. In order to defeat ISIS, we must be willing to call it what it is: Islamic extremism. When 21 Coptic Christians were beheaded on the beaches of Egypt, it was the President of Egypt, President Al Sisi—a very brave and pious Muslim—who went into Cairo to visit with the most powerful imams and told them that Islam was in need of a religious revolution. He knew that they must condemn radical Islam and call it what it is: a cancer at the heart of their religion. We have to know what we're up against if we are to defeat it. I, like President Obama, will hold a Camp David summit, but not to talk our allies into a bad deal with Iran to cement my legacy. Instead, I will discuss with our Arab allies how we can support them in their fight against ISIS. They know this is their fight but they must see leadership and resolve and support from us. We will arm the Kurds as they have been requesting for three long years. I will provide King Abdullah, a fine man, with the bombs and materiel he has requested—instead of putting him in a position to turn to China for help. I will share intelligence with the Egyptians as they have requested. The Kurds, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, and the Saudis are fighting ISIS on the ground as we speak. I will make a promise to our friends in the Middle East to train their troops to fight ISIS—and I will keep that promise. President Obama told us his administration would spend $500 million to train 3000 troops within the next year. We've trained 60. That's simply unacceptable. And what do we see now? ISIS is gaining traction. The FBI now tells us they are more dangerous than al Qaeda. Secretary Clinton and President Obama declared victory in Iraq in 2011 and withdrew. They watched while ISIS grew, and a growing crisis is now spiraling out of control. Here is another truth that we must see and speak and act upon. China is our rising adversary. The Chinese people have tolerated repression, corruption, pollution, and sub standard safety in return for economic growth and an escape from poverty. And we have been an important engine of that growth. This gives us real leverage. We have the ability to impact their economy and change their calculation. China is using their economic might to rewrite the global order. They are now the world's largest purchaser of oil. They loan money to developing nations to build roads and other critical infrastructure—but they are not doing it for goodwill. China wants these countries' natural resources. We are not giving these countries a viable alternative. China has quickly built an international banking institution to rival the World Bank. China is building their economic power and will wield it ruthlessly. We are a nation founded on entrepreneurship, innovation, creativity, and open markets. Our prosperity is boundless. The Chinese people are willing to tolerate an oppressive regime in exchange for growth—but in fact this lack of freedom will ultimately limit their growth. There are cracks in the façade already. Just a few weeks ago, we saw their stock market in free fall and another 8 point plunge over night. The Chinese government is trying to prop up their markets, but this is not a lasting solution. Our next president must realize this opportunity and respond with confidence, using the tools we have here at home. For example, the Chinese, like the Iranians and the Russians, engage in draconian internet censorship. As Reagan once torn down a physical wall, we must tear down these cyber barriers to the free exchange of information. China has moved aggressively into the South China Sea, building islands in the middle of the ocean so that they can build military bases on top of these islands. This is a gateway that moves $5 trillion worth of trade every year. China cannot be permitted to control this gateway. Our current President largely created this situation. In 2012, President Obama brokered a deal between the Philippines and China to withdraw from a disputed portion of the South China Sea together—and China violated that agreement. We stood by as the Chinese went from testing the waters to jumping all the way in. We must push back against rising Chinese aggression. We should work with Vietnam and the Philippines to improve their surveillance capabilities to deter the Chinese. We should conduct military exercises with our Filipino friends. We must tell China—if you declare an Air Defense Identification Zone over the South China Sea, we will not recognize it. We will not comply. Even this will not be enough. The Chinese are continuing to expand and improve their nuclear arsenal. They are working hard to develop satellite and other technologies to counter our weapons advantage. They have long worried about our nuclear advantage and are now taking this opportunity to quietly build up their own arsenal and erode our position. We should help our Australian friends obtain military capabilities that they need and want. We should support the Japanese efforts to expand their forces. We must stand beside our allies. They will grow more resolute and stand up to those who seek to shift the balance of power. The Chinese steal our intellectual property with impunity and engage in state sponsored cyberterrorism. The Chinese government has stolen the personal information of over 20 million Americans. We've known that the Chinese were seeking to infiltrate our networks for over a decade. We've also known about the vulnerabilities in those networks. And yet, once again, the government bureaucracy was too bloated and inept to act and the political classes were too complacent to stop it. Having obtained the highest security clearances available to a civilian, I know the Chinese now possess all my personal information. This is more than a bureaucratic failing. The Chinese now possess incredibly valuable intelligence information. The answer from the political class is to demand the resignation of the head of OPM. But what has been done to protect us from future cyberattacks? Has anything changed? The political class moved on as soon as the outrage subsided and the bureaucracy continues to lumber along. And let's not forget our former Secretary of State told us her private server was protected from hacking because she had two Secret Service agents guarding it. We weren't worried about your server being stolen, Mrs. Clinton. We were worried about it being hacked. Or worse, used as a back door to hack into the State Department system, which is exactly what appears to have happened at OPM. The next President must understand technology. She must understand both how to use it to harness the power of our citizenry to challenge the status quo of Washington and to protect and defend our nation. As Mrs. Clinton now runs for President, she likes to talk about her support of human rights, women's rights and democracy. Her actions conflict with her words. During her first trip to Asia as Secretary in February 2009, she told us we couldn't let human rights get in the way of our other goals. China responded. They cracked down on American companies, charitable organizations and free speech. They have thrown Nobel Peace Prize winners in jail. Trafficking and domestic violence continue. Forced abortions and death by exposure have ended the lives of countless millions and millions of female infants. Repressive regimes elsewhere in the world took notice as well. Mrs. Clinton personally gave the Russians a reset button, just as the human rights situation in that country took a drastic turn for the worse. In Iran, when the Green Movement demonstrated against the murderous Ahmadinejad regime, she went silent. China, Russia, Iran, and terrorist groups such as ISIS—these are the big human rights tests of our time. Women and girls are systematically targeted, subjugated, murdered, raped and sold into bondage. It is the height of hypocrisy for Hillary Clinton to run for President as a champion of women's rights when her record as Secretary of State is this dismal. Our ideals are a light that shines in the very darkest corners of the world. Today, without American leadership, we have too many dark corners. I see our nation at a crossroads. Margaret Thatcher—a woman I admire greatly—once said that she was not content to manage the decline of a great nation. Neither am I. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of a great nation. I—like all of you—am deeply proud of our extraordinary nation and grateful to be an American. This gratitude and pride is called patriotism. It is one of the greatest things about our country and our enemies hate it. In 2013, Vladimir Putin wrote in an op ed to the New York Times that our patriotism is dangerous. Just two weeks ago, as we negotiated with Iran, the Supreme Leader denounced our people as the ultimate embodiment of arrogance. Tyrants know that our patriotism, our principles, and our policies enable us to be a leader on the global stage. Today, Americans sense danger at home and abroad. People all over the world know the fundamentals of freedom and human dignity are threatened. And when we abandon an ally or embolden an adversary, it reverberates throughout the world, and as we tragically know, those ripples can too easily land on our shores. We need a President who will see and speak and act on the truth. We need a President who knows that some things are black and white and who will be a clear eyed advocate for policies formed by principles, not by polls and politics. We need a President who will reassure our allies that we are a friend who can be trusted and who will show our adversaries that we will not be bullied or intimidated. We must nominate and elect a president who proudly accepts the mantel of leadership that a weary world is eager for us to wear. I know what such leadership requires. I will recognize dangers with eyes wide open but will also embrace with open arms the enormous opportunities and potential of these amazing times. I am prepared to be a President who will lead the resurgence of this great nation, here at home and around the world. Thank you and may God continue to bless our extraordinary nation. Thank you. It's great to be in Tampa with so many friends. Today, we begin a four day trip across Florida, South Carolina, and New Hampshire to tell the Florida story. The story of a big, diverse state, shaped by conservative, results oriented leadership. Reforming government. Disrupting the status quo. Challenging the special interests. Restoring opportunity. Refusing to compromise in the defense of freedom. Lifting people up, not tearing them down. Standing up for everyone. Our story is about action. Doing, not just talking. Listening, not just lecturing. That is my story. And I'm so grateful and honored to have had the opportunity to lead this great state as your governor. Last year, I decided that I wanted to share my story with people across the country. So, I wrote a book. Well really, I didn't write it. Not in a traditional sense. I emailed it! They used to call me the e governor. For eight years, I gave out my email address to anyone who wanted to talk to me. And email they did! People across the state told me their stories. Sometimes they asked questions. Sometimes they asked for help. One lady asked me to get a raccoon out of her attic, and I got my team right on it! But Floridians always gave me their opinions. And man, they didn't hold back. So, I listened. I tried to answer every email. It wasn't something I could have predicted at the start of my time in office, but this 8 year conversation with Florida shaped my governorship. So, in writing my book, I used my email exchanges to tell the Florida story. To tell about the work to turn one of America's largest states into an economic engine where people could live, work and raise their family in safety and security With huge promise for the future and free from the heavy hand of government. That is what my book is about. That is why I am running for the Presidency of the United States. You see, America is in a time of testing, at home and abroad. People are frustrated. People are worried about what the future holds for our nation. And I share that sentiment with them. Our economy has suffered its slowest recovery since the Great Depression. One in ten able bodied Americans can't find full time work, or have given up looking altogether. One in seven Americans lives in poverty. One in five children is on food stamps. Barack Obama has given us two trillion dollars of new taxes, but still managed to grow the national debt by eight trillion, placing an immoral burden on working families and the next generation. The world is in turmoil, as America withdraws from its responsibilities. ISIS has declared a Caliphate the size of Indiana. In Syria and Iraq, they are indiscriminately killing moderate Muslims, Christians, Western journalists anyone who stands in the way of their fanatic ideology. Red lines get crossed without consequence, unleashing a humanitarian crisis as four million Syrian refugees flee their native land. Vladimir Putin is siding with the brutal Syrian dictator; sending weapons systems to Iran; and continuing to defy the Western world in Ukraine. All the while, our President has negotiated an agreement that gives legitimacy to Tehran and does nothing to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. For the first time in the history of Israel, its greatest existential threat has been created by its greatest ally. The 2016 election arrives at the juncture of our failures abroad, and restlessness at home. And soon, Americans will once again enter a time for choosing A chance to set a new course for the country. As you may have heard, last week, I was in Colorado for the third Republican presidential debate. If you watched the debate, you probably came away thinking this election is about sound bitesor fantasy footballor which candidate can interrupt the loudest. I'm here to tell you it's not. This election is not about a set of personalities. It's about a set of principles. It is about leadership. It is about the right vision to lead America through turbulent waters, after two terms of a divider in chief who has sliced and diced the electorate by class, income, grievance and creed. So the choice we face is whether to summon the courage to give rise to an era of new possibility or to indulge this new age of cynicism. For all his promise, perhaps President Obama's greatest accomplishment is that of creating competing pessimisms. Members of his own party are left explaining how two percent growth, massive debt, and increasing global isolation are really the best we can do. They speak in delusional terms about containing ISIS; about trusting the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism; about how the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian soil doesn't underscore the president's empty words and total inaction. It's not working. And all President Obama has left is the politics of divide and conquer. Signing lawless executive orders that ignore the Constitution and launching partisan attacks, such as comparing his critics to Iranian hard liners. Americans have had enough of our president's many strawman arguments. And, of a front running candidate who blames a vast right wing conspiracy instead of taking personal responsibility, and who declares roughly half the country is her enemy. If Secretary Clinton has her way, the next four years will be like the last eight: gridlock, grievance, division, demonization. This is the only way they know how to win. On the issue of immigration, they have written a script for Republicans, filled with grievance and resentment. Frankly, the last thing they want is a Republican challenger who takes them out of their comfort zone of forced indignation and PC platitudes. But let me be clear: I'm not stepping into the role of angry agitator that they have created for us, because it's not what's in my heart. It is not true to the conservative cause. And, in the end, that role is just a bit part in the story of another conservative loss and another liberal victory. That's their plan, and I'm not going to play along. But I fear the President has already succeeded in setting the trap for our party, bringing a new pessimism on the right. Some people on the debate stage talked of a country that was once great, but now is in dramatic decline. They say our best days are behind us. I acknowledge the difficulties and challenges we face. But I reject this kind of thinking. Not because I don't understand it, but because I know it is not true. There is an important place in our politics for righteous indignation. But anger that leads to resentment without delivering results will take us down a path to perdition. I believe America's best days are not behind us, but squarely in front of us. If we elect the right leadership. And as your President, I will fight every day with a reformer's heart. I will lead. And I will tear down the barriers that keep Americans from rising up and realizing their god given potential. I will do so keenly aware of the problems that give rise to the deep frustration all of us share frustration over a porous border workers' wages remaining stagnant and an ever shrinking pie for families living paycheck to paycheck. This won't be solved with more talk. The answer isn't sending someone from one side of the capital city to the other. The solution won't be found in someone who has never demonstrated the capacity to implement conservative ideas. And you can't just tell Congress You're Fired and go to a commercial break. You have to bring people together to solve problems. The challenges we face as a nation are too great to roll the dice on another presidential experiment. To trust the rhetoric of reform over a record of reform. After seven years of incompetence, corruption and gridlock in Washington, we need a president who can fix it. I can fix it. After seven years of historic cuts to our militarya foreign policy based on leading from behindthe emboldening of our enemies and the isolation of our allieswe need a president who fixes America's standing abroad. I can fix it. After seven years of massive deficits, historic debt, and a president who vetoes defense spending because he wants more reckless spending, we need a president who fixes our budgetary mess. I can fix it. I know I can fix itbecause I've done it. In Florida, we showed how strong, hands on leadership could make a difference in the lives of people. I gave out my email address because I wanted Floridians to know that their governor cared about them and wanted to help solve their problems. I remember emailing with an honor student named Kirsty Edwards who couldn't pass the FCAT to graduate because of her disability. We listened and changed the law so Kirsty could get her high school diploma and go onto graduate from college. I remember emailing with single moms like Tina Calloway who needed help collecting child support from absent fathers. Their calls for assistance motivated us to increase child support collection by 90 percent. And I remember emailing with teachers like Alleen Miller who joined our cause of improving schools, even though their union pressured them to fight us every step of the way. I went to Tallahassee as an agent of change. I turned the political culture of Tallahassee upside down. I'm putting The Beltway on notice. I'll turn Washington upside down too. We took on the teachers union to make Florida a national leader in parental choice and school accountability. We took on the public employee union to shrink the size of the state bureaucracy by 11 percent. We took on trial lawyers to rein in frivolous lawsuits and make our business climate more conducive to small business growth. And we took on big spending politicians from both parties to balance eight budgets and cut taxes eight years in a row by a total of $19 billion. By the way, I vetoed 2500 line items, eliminating more than $2 billion of pork barrel spending. My good friend and the Speaker of the House, John Thrasher, reacted by calling me Veto Corleone. That was not meant as a term of endearment at the time, but I wear it as a badge of honor today. The story of my governorship was one of using conservative principles to provide people with opportunity to improve their lives. I governed on the premise that there are no second class citizens. No second rate dreams. In America, every citizen is an asset. Every life matters. And every American has a right to rise to their god given potential. If you want a president who maintains the status quo, I am not your candidate. But if you want fundamental conservative reformreform that can be found in the record, not just the rhetoricthen I ask for your support. Our times are difficult, but not nearly as difficult as what Lincoln faced when he took office what FDR faced on December 8th of 1941. We have long been blessed with a benevolent presidency. Leaders who turned both our highest hopes and our worst fears into dramatic, lasting change that left the world a better place. Leaders who held the nation's highest office with humility. Who went on bended knee before God, asking His help in carrying out orders that would determine the fate of millions. It was Lincoln who spoke at his second Inauguration a few weeks before the end of the war soothing words of healing and hope, With malice toward none, with charity for all. With firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in If Lincoln were alive today, imagine the foolishness he would have to suffer. Advisers telling him to shave his beard. Cable pundits telling him to lose the top hat. Opposition researchers calling him a five time loser before the age of 50. I have gotten a lot of advice lately myselfmore than enough. Some is stylistic. Take off the suit coat. Ditch the glasses. Get rid of the purple striped tie. Man, I like that tie. Some advice is more strategic. Nail that zinger. Be angrier. Hide your inner wonk. But I have learned two important things from my time serving the people of Florida: One, I can't be someone I'm not. And, two, getting things done isn't about yelling into a camera, or regurgitating sound bites free of substance. The campaign trail is littered with candidates disguised as television critics. Politicians echoing poll tested pabulum. But leadership is something far different. It's not about telling people what they want to hear, but what they must hear. It's not about saying the right thing, but doing the right thing. And it's not about tearing people down, but about bringing people together. I will do everything in my power to win this race, but there are some things I am not willing to do: I will not compromise my principles, I will not trade in an optimistic outlook to put on the cloak of an angry agitator. And I will not make anyone feel small so I can feel big. Americans are looking for a president, not a pundita leader and not a protester. For seven years we have been led by a cynic in chief. It is time we elected a Commander in chief. A president who knows leadership involves summoning the will and creativity to solve tomorrow's challenges and seize tomorrow's opportunities. I am running this campaign on my own terms. And let me tell you something: when the dust clears, and the delegates are counted, we will win this campaign. I will be true to myself, optimistic and inclusive. I will win appealing to our better angels, and not our greatest fears. And I will win with a message that welcomes all and includes all, because I will be a president who fights for all. Join me in this journey. Fight with me as we work to fundamentally change the culture of Washington. Let us seek to redeem the promise of a fledgling Republic formed well over 200 years ago. A land full of endless promise and limitless possibility for all so blessed to be called Americans. The future is in our hands. Let us seize it together with faith, hope and trust. In ourselves. In one another. In the God who made us and guides us. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you for coming here today. I have come to New Hampshire today to talk about the challenges we're facing as a country. Through its unwillingness to address our biggest challenges in an honest way, the Obama Administration has put us on a perilous course for both our short term and long term futures. It is time to tell the truth about what we need to do in order to solve our problems and put our country back on the path to greater prosperity. One of those challenges is the unrestrained growth of government spending on entitlements. In the short term, it is growing the deficit and slowly but surely taking over all of government. In the long term, it will steal our children's future and bankrupt our nation. Meanwhile, our leaders in Washington are not telling people the truth. Washington is still not dealing with the problem. Washington is afraid to have an honest conversation about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid with the people of our country. I am not. Washington refuses to acknowledge that we have a crisis on our hands. We need to force them to acknowledge the crisis and fix it. And unless we deal with this crisis, the young people of this country will get poorer; the disparity between young and old, the working middle class and the retired will grow even larger. Our economy will grow even weaker. Our debt will skyrocket. Considering entitlements and interest make up almost 70% of the budget and the Obama Administration has run up the debt to a record $18 trillion, you'd think we'd be having a more robust, honest debate about them. Yet, most politicians in Washington stay as far away from this issue as they can. Democrats believe entitlements are a sacred cow that cannot be honestly discussed, perpetuating a dangerous fantasy to the American people—that these programs will always be there, even if we do nothing. They are wrong. Let me be clear. The changes I propose today would not affect seniors currently in these programs or seniors approaching retirement. Let me repeat that: these changes will not affect you, but will save these programs for your grandchildren. Anyone who tells you differently is simply not telling you the truth. We should and we must ensure that Social Security and Medicare exist to prevent our seniors from falling into poverty. The truth is that the majority of our seniors who need these programs have spent their lives working hard, providing for their families and living within their means. They have earned the right to live out their later years without the fear of poverty. But I am also here to tell you that the fairness we seek must be broad and must be earned. This fairness must cover our hard working taxpayers footing the bills today and must include reforming these programs to ensure their existence today and for future generations. This is a conversation Washington politicians don't have because they do not believe the American people have the appetite for hard truths. Once again, they underestimate our people. Americans not only deserve fairness, they deserve the honesty of their leaders. The concept of fairness, which underpinned the rationale for creating these programs in the first place, is being turned on its head. Consider this: In 1960, when John F. Kennedy was elected President, 26% of the federal budget was spent on payments to individuals. Today, that number is 71%. That is incredible. Why has it happened? In the last 25 years, while our economy has grown by over 200%, Medicare has grown by 539%. Medicaid and related programs have grown by well over 800%. They are 9 times as big as they were 25 years ago and the US economy is only 3 times as big. This is not sustainable. You know it. I know it. The American people know it. But professional politicians in Washington refuse to lead and are putting our future at risk. When these programs were enacted, too many senior citizens lived in poverty. The good news is that we have made progress over the years on that problem. Now, however, we have a new problem: as of 2011 over 20% of children in America live in poverty. We spend over 56% of the income per every worker on seniors, while spending only 8% on children. I believe the grandmothers and grandfathers of America would be appalled to know this. Not only does this inaction drive more children into poverty, if we do not deal with this crisis now, these programs which have helped to prevent poverty for America's elderly today, will be bankrupt and gone for the very people who are paying for them, our hard working, young American middle class. The 65 and over population will increase by 102% between 2011 and 2050, while the working age population will increase by just 17% over that same period. As the elderly population rises, the number of workers who pay into Social Security is dropping. By 2030, there will be about two workers per retiree, down from 3 workers in 2000. Just let that fact settle in for a minute. So let's have a conversation. Why do we have Social Security? Why do we have Medicare? We have them because we believe as a country that we should not let aging Americans fall into poverty after a lifetime of work. We believe that our seniors should not fear that they will be unable to make any ends meet as they grow older. This is a promise worth keeping. Now let's talk about how we do that today and not in the context of when these programs were first created back in 1935 and 1965. It is about fairness among and between American generations. And it is about telling all Americans the truth, and without delay. If you believe we should keep this promise, as I do, that all Americans should have access to the economic security these programs provide, then that costs money. Do we want to confront this by enacting backbreaking tax increases on our middle class, the size of which this country has never seen? Do we want to risk the breaking of this promise to our future seniors through further delay and inaction? Do we want to destroy our country's future prospects because of a mountain of debt we can't manage? I reject all of those alternatives. So how do we really fix the problem and not just get the usual set of political talking points? I've put together a 12 point proposal to start a conversation about how we reform these programs. None of these points would undermine our commitment to care for those most in need. None would destroy the retirement security of older Americans. But together, they would take over one trillion dollars from the growing pile of rapidly amassing government benefits, and start us on the road to making these programs solvent for generations in the future. I'm going to talk about the biggest pieces of this proposal first, starting with Social Security. Again, why do we have Social Security? It's there so our seniors, after a lifetime of hard work, don't fall into poverty. Which means it should be there for those who need it. Now, the problem is that Social Security is, of course, the largest entitlement. In fact, it is the largest federal program, with projected spending of $896 billion in the current fiscal year. While it is not growing as fast as Medicaid or Medicare, it is slowly working its way to insolvency, which the actuaries say will come in the early 2030s, less than 20 years from now. Social Security will come under increasing stress as the number of workers relative to the number of beneficiaries continues to shrink. As it is, Social Security in the coming decades will pay out a trillion more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Like that for Medicare, the fiscal picture for Social Security has been affected pretty dramatically by increases in life expectancy over time. This is a good thing. Americans are living longer. This is something to celebrate but, at the same time, we can't ignore the real effect that has on Social Security. So how do we react to this? We should remember that Social Security should be retirement insurance. I'm suggesting that Americans pay into this system throughout the course of their life knowing that it will be there if they need it to support them. So that seniors will not grow old in back breaking poverty. But if you are fortunate enough not to need it, you will have paid into a system that will continue to help Americans who need it most. That is what we have always done for each other through private charity and good government. This is fair and it is what we must continue to do by changing Social Security. Let's ask ourselves an honest question: do we really believe that the wealthiest Americans need to take from younger, hard working Americans to receive what, for most of them, is a modest monthly Social Security check? I propose a modest means test that only affects those with non Social Security income of over $80000 per year, and phases out Social Security payments entirely for those that have $200000 a year of other income. This would affect less than 2 percent of all recipients, but would contribute to the overall health of the system and recognize that the wealthiest among us don't need this benefit when it comes at such great cost to our fiscal health and the opportunity to future generations. We should apply the same concept to Medicare. Medicare, which provides healthcare for senior citizens, is not growing as fast as Medicaid, but it is larger, in terms of federal government spending, at least as of today. Now as everyone knows, most Americans have paid money through payroll taxes to help pay for this health coverage in their later years. But there is a problem: the payroll taxes and receipts the government collects today cover only about half of the gross cost of Medicare benefits and, according to CBO, that proportion will shrink to about a third over the next 25 years. The share of GDP devoted to Medicare has grown sharply since its enactment 50 years ago, and the share of the population enrolled in Medicare has continued to grow. Today it stands at 16%, but that number will go up with an aging population. So again, I ask the question. Why do we have Medicare? We have Medicare to give our seniors access to health care and to stop them from falling into poverty in the process. Let's keep it simple, if you can afford to pay more for your health benefits you should and if you can't, you should not. Fairness for seniors who need it. Fairness to middle class Americans paying for it today. Medicare is already means tested to a certain extent, with the 25% of the true premium cost that seniors pay for part B and part D rising on a sliding scale starting at incomes above $85000 all the way up to 80% cost sharing for those with incomes above $214000. We should expand the sliding scale that already exists. Seniors with an $85000 a year income will pay 40% of premium costs and increasing it to 90% above $196000 a year. This increased means testing should apply to Medicare Part D, the drug prescription program, as well. Over the last few years, the prescription drug program has become more expensive than it first was as Democrats in the Senate acted to close the donut hole. Higher cost shares for wealthier older Americans in part D can help address that growing cost. Now, additionally, Americans are living longer and more productive lives today than at any point in our history. This development is an overwhelmingly positive one for our nation and our economy and the retirement system must be adjusted to reflect these new gains in longevity. When Medicare was enacted, a man's life expectancy in the United States was about 67 years old, and that for a woman was 73. Today, life expectancy in this country is 79 for a man and 82 for a woman. We need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. I'm proposing we raise the age to 69, gradually implementing this change starting in 2022 and increasing the retirement age by 2 months each year until it reaches 69. I also believe we need to raise the early retirement age at a similar pace, raising it by 2 months per year until it reaches 64 from the current level of 62. Which means we should do the same for Medicare. We should raise eligibility age at a manageable pace of one month per year, so that by 2040 it would be 67 years old, and by 2064 would be 69 years old. Raising the eligibility age, slowly so that people can plan for it, has another advantage. It encourages seniors to remain in the workforce. With life expectancy rising and both work conditions and general health of older Americans increasing over time, raising the retirement age makes sense, and it also encourages productive senior citizens to remain in the workforce. A widely quoted study conducted some years ago by experts at the RAND Corporation found that the proportion of older Americans who can perform the simple tasks of everyday life has risen significantly over time. This is a good thing. I believe in the dignity of work, and America needs a larger labor force to help our growth. So we should encourage work, and like many of the proposals I will make today, this is a pro work change. We should take an additional positive step to encourage remaining in the workforce. Let's encourage work by reducing taxes for working seniors through eliminating their payroll tax. Seniors who keep working past the age of 62 have paid their fair share to the government and shouldn't have to keep paying payroll taxes for Social Security when it won't really significantly increase the benefits they receive. By the way, economists estimate that this payroll tax cut for those over 62 would contribute to labor supply growth and therefore GDP growth in the US. This growth would offset much of the lost revenues from the tax cut. Next, let's discuss Medicaid. It should be no surprise that Medicaid is the fastest growing federal entitlement, and the most problematic. It is on a path to bankrupt not only the federal government, but the states as well. Its span is massive, now covering over 72 million Americans. Like many government programs, it is operated devoid of common sense. Too much care is delivered in the emergency room, the most expensive place. In most states, there is no co pay and no deductible. So, as in much of American health care, there is no incentive for the patient to worry about costs or rationally use health care resources. And I can tell you this, as a governor, the federal government sets rules, and has a tedious and time consuming process for any innovation by the states. It is unduly complex and frustrating. As a bipartisan panel of governors recently wrote, in discussing Medicaid: Too often, policies adopted at the national level, though they may have been well intended, result in federal over reach and trigger unintended and undesired consequences. How do we change this and still protect our neediest citizens? The federal government should administer Medicaid by sending the states a fixed amount per enrollee. The per capita cap could be different for each category of Medicaid recipient, the elderly, disabled, children, and non elderly non disabled adults. And the cap amount could be allowed to grow, with the inflation rate, each year. This approach takes into account growth in population or in costs and, even with the per enrollee cost growing at the inflation rate, this approach, according to the CBO, would reduce the deficit by well over a half a trillion dollars over the next ten years. What else do we need to do? It's also time to make the process of a state like mine getting a Medicaid waiver simpler, less time consuming, and repeatable. As things stand now, governors and their states walk on eggshells for over a year or more while waivers to do perfectly rational things are debated by bureaucrats in Washington. We should have templates for waivers that have worked in one state to make them easy to approve in another. The process should be much more clear, transparent, and quick. Another entitlement program that is also on the verge of bankruptcy is the Social Security disability insurance program. The share of working age Americans collecting disability has doubled in the last twenty years, from 2% to 4%. The disability rolls have increased by over 1 million just since January 2009, to more than 11 million people. This is up from just 2 million in 1986. The Social Security disability trust fund, without action by congress, is scheduled to run out of money next year, in 2016. President Obama proposes to reallocate hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security payroll tax retirement revenues to the disability trust fund with no strings attached, but I believe we should use this moment to reform the system and incentivize getting back to work. In the Netherlands, before a worker can go on disability they must first work with their employer to create a rehabilitation plan, and they must act on it. The Dutch also provide a tax break for those employers who keep the disabled on the job. This simple reform has had an effect. Holland has disability rates similar to ours, but these reforms have had the effect of reducing the flow of new disability beneficiaries by 60% in 6 years. We should encourage those who truly are able to work to get back to work. Let's increase the requirements on the number of years in which an applicant has worked in recent years, speed up the time which a determination about whether someone is eligible for disability is made and the time in which a beneficiary must return to work if their injury is only temporary. At the same time we should encourage vocational rehab, wage subsidies and preventive care services to keep an individual working with additional support. Beyond these concepts, I also believe we must take these additional steps in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid: We need to more accurately measure inflation, while giving seniors 85 or older added protection. Social Security growth should be based on the true growth in the cost of living. To provide added protection for the elderly who are most impacted by fluctuations in consumer prices, a one time 5 percent increase in monthly benefits will be provided to all beneficiaries when they reach the age of 85. For Medicare, the rules for cost sharing deductibles, caps on coverage, and co pays, are all over the map. There are different types of deductibles and cost sharing depending on the type of service provided and where it is provided. We should do exactly what the bipartisan Simpson Bowles report, a report which President Obama ignored -proposed. Simplify all this by having a uniform single annual deductible of $550, a uniform coinsurance rate of 20%, 5% cost sharing above out of pocket expenses of $5500 in a year, and a hard cap of $7500 a year in cost sharing. This makes sense to me. It is simpler. It will save money. We should do it. · Over 65% of Medicaid spending goes to the elderly and disabled. One of the biggest cost drivers in the program is spending on those who are dual eligible, that is, eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. Right now, Medicare provides the basic health care coverage for this population and Medicaid is used to fund co pays, contributions, and gaps in Medicare. I'm proposing if a recipient is going to receive Medicaid for this purpose, then they must receive Medicare coverage through a managed care organization. My state does this, and it saves money. And it is not a partisan issue. California requires the same thing. This should be our national policy. We should take the simple step of requiring a small co pay for Medicaid recipients, something on the order of $10 for a doctor or clinic visit, and $20 for a hospital visit, at least for those Medicaid recipients with incomes above the poverty level. This will encourage better decisions by patients for both their health and the costs of their benefits. We must introduce some economics into the decision making process. And it is only fair, as most Americans have a co pay requirement in their private plans. These proposals do not answer every question; they don't represent everything we can do, but they are much more than anyone has been willing to do in Washington and they begin to tell our people the truth. They protect those most in need, while being fair to those who are not. They are bipartisan and they are eminently doable. Today. Together, just taking these dozen steps will save over $1 trillion in the next decade. The costs of not tackling this problem are staggering, and threatening most of all to the young St. Anselm's students in this room. First of all, no action will guarantee that the big safety net and retirement programs, Social Security, Medicare, and others, will be bankrupt and insolvent by the time you retire. Second, no action will mean that the taxes you pay will do nothing but pay benefits to others and that those taxes will skyrocket to crushing levels. Every other national priority will be sacrificed, our economic growth will grind to a complete halt and our national security will be put at even graver risk. Already, our national defense has been hollowed out by years of underinvestment. A bipartisan group of experts last year published a sobering report and continues to sound the alarm. The navy has gone from 600 ships to being on a path to 260. The air force is flying today the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft it has ever flown. In the face of underfunding and sequester, the number of active duty forces in the army is shrinking to 1990s levels, and only a handful of army brigades are ready for crisis response. This decline in defense, in the face of projected massive deficits and fiscal imbalance, and despite a world that remains full of challenges and threats, is what the Harvard economic historian Niall Ferguson has called the fatal arithmetic of imperial decline. And if we don't get our finances in order as a country, long term decline will inevitably be our fate. President Obama has left us a debtor nation. In his short time in office, he has almost doubled the national debt, increasing it by over $8 trillion. To the extent he and the Congress have been able to reach small agreements on fiscal matters, they have generally focused on the part of the budget which is not the problem, so called domestic discretionary spending, which is only 15% of the budget this year. And in any event, this part of the budget has only grown at roughly the inflation rate plus 1% for the last 25 years. In other words, it has grown at less than the rate of the US economy. One more thing that is important to note here. There is no question that America would be better off with a market oriented, more flexible, more pro consumer choice health care system than the one that was jammed down our throats by this President. Obamacare does not and cannot work for America. If the facts I have outlined today prove anything, I believe they prove that we do not need and cannot afford an additional Washington controlled entitlement program—which is exactly what Obamacare is today. The trouble is that while the Courts and the Congress debate and decide whether Obamacare can stand as it is or can be repealed and replaced, the growth of the entitlement beast continues unabated. In fact, in many ways it is turbo charged by Obamacare. I will have more to say on Obamacare in the weeks and months ahead. And I will address it in the same direct and specific way I have addressed Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid with all of you today. You see, we need to recognize that solving our biggest problems, like the growth of entitlements, can be done, but only with real leadership that tells the truth to the very people we aspire to lead. When I took over as governor of New Jersey, my predecessor Jon Corzine had left us a mess. Record deficits. The highest top tax rates and overall tax burden in the country. Schools that were failing. Liabilities that were unaddressed and out of control. People said New Jersey could never be turned around, but we took action. Cut 230 programs in the first year, and over 800 in the second year. And balanced six budgets in a row, without raising taxes. In fact, I vetoed every tax increase the democratic legislature ever sent me. Reformed pension and health care benefits to reduce the burden on taxpayers by over $120 billion over 30 years. Reformed teacher tenure for the first time in a century so that ineffective teachers can actually be removed from our children's classrooms. Capped property taxes. And so far, we have added 175000 private sector jobs in New Jersey, while shrinking the cost of government and state government employment by over 85000 employees in 5 years. It wasn't easy, and we're far from finished. But New Jersey has begun to turn around, and we're growing, not shrinking. It won't be easy to turn around the fiscal mess that Barack Obama has left us either. He has avoided the tough decisions. Imagine that the straightforward discussion I've had with you today, President Obama has been afraid to have with you for the last eight years, from the day he declared for president in February of 2007 to this very day. Is that real leadership for America? It is not. It is typical of the timid and failed leadership of Barack Obama. It will take time to put in place all the measures we need to fully tap America's potential. But there is no time like the present to get started. Strong, decisive and honest leadership matters for America. It is only when governors, and presidents, and concerned citizens, decide to step up and take action that we can solve our problems. Problems won't get solved if we wait for others to solve them, or if we are afraid to confront what we know to be true. Today, we know this: our entitlement system is out of control. Its growth is not sustainable. And inaction threatens the economic health of every generation that will follow us. So let's confront this problem head on. Let's take the steps we can take today, and resolve to do even more tomorrow. Let's come together for a better America, and not sit idly by while our prospects fade and our divisions grow. I know some in both political parties will criticize these ideas. Some will surrender to the divisiveness, the fear mongering and the scare tactics that are generously served on the political menu in Washington, DC every day. They will flip flop from previous stands to curry favor; they will pretend that change will lead to peril. My fellow Americans, peril is already here and it has been caused by our refusal to change, not by honestly embracing the real change that brings fairness to every generation. These are the truths you all know in your gut, I want to give voice to those common sense truths you already know. Here's what you'll learn about me. I have been talking about the growth of entitlements as a big problem, at both the state and federal levels, for a number of years. Not because it is politically popular, but because it is true. And because it will affect everything we can do as a country to make this century the second American century. I will not pander. I will not flip flop. I am not afraid to tell you the truth as I see it. I want to help lead a national conversation that rewards truth over pandering; that rewards innovation over the timidity of the status quo; that honors the power of our history over the fear of failure. That's what leadership is all about. And that is why I am so pleased that you let me join you today here in New Hampshire to talk about our future. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. My mother was a smoker. She smoked her whole life. She was addicted to nicotine. She started when she was 16 years old, which was 1948. But by the time 1964 came, the Surgeon General's report came out, and she was in her mid-30s, she knew that smoking was bad for you. And I tell you I watched her as a kid growing up. She tried everything she could to quit. She had the gum, the patches, and hypnosis. She tried everything. She couldn't quit. Now, when she turned 71, a little after that, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. No one came to me and said, "Don't treat her, because she got what she deserved." We know that lung cancer was caused by the smoking. We know it was. But no one came to me and said, "Hey, listen. Your mother was dumb. She started smoking when she was 16. Then after we told her it was bad for her, she kept doing it. So we're not going to give her chemotherapy. We're not going to give her radiation. We're not going to give her any of that stuff. You know why? Because she's getting what she deserves." No one said that. No one said that about someone who had cancer. Yet somehow, if it's heroin or cocaine or alcohol, we say, "They decided it. They're getting what they deserved." I'm pro life. And I think that if you're pro life, that means you've got to be pro life for the whole life, not just for the nine months they're in the womb, all right? It's easy. It's easy to be pro life for the nine months they're in the womb. They haven't done anything to disappoint us yet, all right? They're perfect in there. But when they get out, that's when it gets tough. The 16 year old teenage girl on the floor of the county lockup addicted to heroin, I'm pro life for her too. Her life is just as much a precious gift from God as the one in the womb. And we need to start thinking that way as a party and as a people, and the president needs to say those things. I'm going to give you a second example. I'm a recovering lawyer. Thank you. I went to law school. And for any of you who went to law school, if anybody here is a lawyer too, you can admit it privately if you want later too, but the people that you're closest to from law school are those people who are in your first year study group. First year, when you're nervous as heck, you don't know. You don't know what is up and what's down. Are you going to make it or not make it? You have this small group of people that everybody puts together. There were eight of us in my group, and we studied together, and you get to see everybody at their absolute worst. These are your best friends in law school. One of the guys that was in my study group gave me his profile. We went to law school at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. He came from an Ivy League school to Seton Hall. He was the smartest of all of us. He became an editor of the Law Review. He was the first one of us who got a job out of school. He got at a big prominent law firm in our state. He's making more money than any of the rest of us. He married an incredibly beautiful woman who's a doctor. They have three gorgeous daughters, one cuter, happier, and more talented than the next. He was the first one among us to become a partner at his law firm. He brought a great house. He had a great car, and worse yet, he was really good looking and in perfect shape. The guy used to run 10, 12 miles a week every week. We loved him, but we hated him, because the guy had everything, right? He was running one day in his normal routine. He hurt his back running. He was in his early 40s and was not giving into age. He was running his normal time, and he hurt his back. He went to the doctor, because he was having trouble working, really hurt. The doctor said, "Listen, we're going to give you some treatment or whatever, but in the meantime, just to help you get through, we're going to give you Percocet to help numb the pain." Well, about a year later, I get a call from his wife. She said, "He's addicted to these painkillers, and he won't listen. I kicked him out of the house, and he's living at his parent's house. You guys need to go and have an intervention with him. Those friends from law school need to go and get him to go to rehab." We all went over there. We had an intervention with him, and it started a 10 year odyssey of him being in and out of rehab. During that period of time, she divorced him. He lost his rights to see his girls. He lost his license to practice law. He lost his driver's license. He lost his home. He bought himself a condo, and she kicked him out. He lost that. He lost all the money, spent all the money that he had saved, and he spent it through most of his retirement. When a year and half ago on a Sunday morning, Mary, Pat, and I got the call that we'd been dreading forever, that they found him dead in a motel room with an empty bottle of Percocet and an empty quart of Vodka, 52 years old. By every measure that we define success in this country, this guy had it. Great looking guy, well educated, great career, plenty of money, beautiful loving wife, beautiful children, great house, he had everything. He's a drug addict, and he couldn't get help, and he's dead. When I sat there as the governor of New Jersey at his funeral, and looked across the pew at this three daughters sobbing, because their dad is gone, there, but before the grace of God, go I. It can happen to anyone. And so we need to start treating people in this country, not jailing them. We need to give them the tools they need to recover, because every life is precious, every life is an individual gift from God. We have to stop judging, and start giving them the tools they need to get better. I come before you, as required by the state constitution, to report on the condition of our state. The state of our state continues to get better. New Jersey is better off than it was last year at this time, and it is certainly far better off than it was just five years ago. While many first years of a second term show a hangover from the campaign and its partisanship, we have fought through that tradition and have real accomplishments to show for that action in 2014. In a year with plenty of politics from some overly partisan corners of this chamber, New Jersey has made progress, growing our economy, creating jobs, reforming our criminal justice system, and improving some of our most challenged cities, like Camden. We've done it because a majority of us care more about our state and New Jersey's middle class than we do about scoring partisan political points. Since last January, the total number of people employed in New Jersey has grown by over 90000, and the number of unemployed has dropped by nearly 30000. We recorded our 5th consecutive year of private sector job growth, and the unemployment rate continues to steadily go down. We have attracted and retained companies, from Subaru USA to the Philadelphia 76ers to Sandoz. We have grown our economy and more people are working, supporting their families and knowing the power of going to work every day in New Jersey today than one year ago. We have done this while holding the line on government spending and government employment. We also extended the successful cap on a key driver of property tax growth. And we passed real criminal justice reform in New Jersey. This bipartisan reform of the bail system keeps violent offenders off the streets and gives non violent offenders who often sit in jail because they can't afford bail a chance to reclaim their lives. This is good for public safety. This is good for families. This is good for New Jersey. Now, despite this progress Despite so much evidence of an improving New Jersey It has become fashionable in some quarters to run down our state. I get it: that's politics. But let's be clear. Our growth in this past year has been part of a trend. A trend that began five years ago. It is easy to forget where we were and how far we have come. Five years ago, our unemployment rate was 9%. Over 440000 New Jerseyans were out of work. Today, the unemployment rate is 6%. We have cut unemployment by over one third in the last 5 years. And we have created over 150000 private sector jobs in New Jersey in five short years. Five years ago, we faced massive consecutive budget deficits,$2 billion for fiscal year 2010 and a projected $11 billion the next year, on a budget of only $29 billion. We fixed it by making hard choices; the way middle class families in New Jersey have to do it in their homes. Today, we have balanced five budgets in a row. And we will balance a sixth this year. And we didn't do it the Washington way, by raising taxes. We did it by cutting spending, shrinking government, and fundamentally reforming the way government operates. This administration believes today, and has always believed, that New Jersey and America, will be a better place for middle class families by shrinking the size of government. Back then, state spending had grown by 56% in the years from 2001 to 2008. Today discretionary spending in our state's budget is $2 billion below its level in fiscal year 2008. Back then, the size of government was out of control. Today, the number of state government employees is 6000 lower than it was five years ago. Back then, New Jersey's highest in the nation property taxes had increased more than 70% in ten years. We averaged a 7% growth in property taxes per year. Today, we have had four years of less than 2% annual property tax growth. Now it's because of the property tax cap we passed together in 2011 is working. This is a bipartisan achievement. We also came together this year to extend the reforms of interest arbitration awards. This act has continued to make property tax control possible. In these past five years, we have delivered needed tax relief to small businesses. The $2 billion small business tax relief package that we continue to phase in is improving New Jersey's business climate and making our state more competitive. That approach is explicit in the sweeping, bipartisan changes we've made to New Jersey's economic incentive programs. I want to congratulate you: we have streamlined these incentives. And we have better targeted them to areas of our state that need investment most. And the verdict is in, and the early returns from the economic opportunity act show that it is working to attract and retain businesses. In total, our pro growth policies and streamlined economic development efforts have brought in over $12 billion of new public and private investment in New Jersey in these last five years. The fact is that, the deeper they look, the more businesses like what they see. From Forbes media to VF Sportswear From Wenner Bread to Bayer Health Care Companies have chosen New Jersey as a home for expansion. We have assets that many other states just cannot match. A highly educated work force A world class transportation network Proximity to large markets The shore. New Jersey has so many attractions. We are America's number two state in biotechnology Number four in per capita income Number three in the use of solar power And in the top ten in data centers. The results of this past year's survey by the New Jersey Business & Industry Association said it best. "Overall", the BIA said, "our members believe the state is continuing to move in the right direction. Things are looking good for small business in 2015." Now, I know that many of you in this room believe that income tax increases are the way to go. So yes, sometimes we will simply have to disagree. I have vetoed four income tax increases passed by this body. And make no mistake I will veto any more income tax increases that come before me. And I will do it for one simple reason, the higher our taxes are, the fewer people and businesses will come to New Jersey and the more who will consider leaving. Raising taxes is the old Trenton way, and it didn't work. Taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before 2010. People and businesses in turn didn't support them and left our state. Between 2004 and 2008 the departure of wealth, investment, and income was staggering, some $70 billion left the state. We have begun a new direction and we need to go further, not reverse course. Because despite all our progress, we have more to do. We have to open our ears and listen to our people. Open our eyes and see what is happening around us. New Jersey just lost Mercedes Benz USA to the state of Georgia. Mercedes, in New Jersey since the early 1970's, is leaving for a very simple reason, it costs less to do business in Georgia than it does in New Jersey. Don't take my word for it, the leaders of Mercedes said it themselves. Economic incentive laws help, but lower taxes are better. We will not win the fight to keep and create good paying jobs for our middle class families in New Jersey unless we lower taxes. Yet I cannot make this a reality alone. It is you, and only you, the State Legislature, who can lower taxes further and make New Jersey more prosperous for our middle class families and their children. I urge the legislature today to open your eyes and ears to the lessons of Mercedes and to act now to lower taxes and prevent another such departure. We have also done much in the past five years to reform our education system. For the first time in 100 years, we came together to reform tenure, so that failing teachers can be removed from the classroom. For the first time, we brought the concept of performance based pay to schools in our largest city, Newark, so that we can pay the best teachers more. We've reformed and re energized public education in Camden under the leadership of Paymon Rouhanifard, a cooperative school advisory board and a supportive mayor and council. We have expanded charter schools. And together we have enacted urban hope legislation to create renaissance schools in our highest risk districts. Finally, for four years in a row, we've provided a record amount in aid to our public schools, over $11 billion in the current fiscal year. But on this, we cannot and should not rest. More school reform is needed. And a great first step would be to pass the opportunity scholarship act, to give parents a choice of a school that meets their child's needs. Let's give families an alternative to chronically failing neighborhood schools. Let's keep driving for better outcomes. Let's give parents and students more choice. At its heart, education is about realizing the potential of every individual. In these past two years, you've joined me in applying this principle to those who face special challenges in life, including the disease of drug addiction. In this last year, we expanded the mandatory drug court program you helped me enact into four new counties, building on those in which courts were established immediately after the law's enactment in 2013. I have a simple view of this. Drug addiction is a disease. It can happen to anyone, from any station in life. And it can be treated. Most importantly, every life is an individual gift from god and no life is disposable. We have an obligation to help people reclaim their lives. And if we have the tools to help those with this disease to save their own lives, we should use them. Requiring mandatory treatment instead of prison for non violent drug offenders is only one step, but an important one. Treatment is the path to saving lives, and for as long as I am governor of New Jersey, treatment will be mandatory in our system and I will not yield. I am proud that in these last two years we've also launched a program to integrate employment services with treatment, so that we can help those with drug addiction not only get clean but get back to work. I am proud that together we enacted an overdose protection law to provide legal protection to people and especially to health care professionals who are trying to help. I am proud that we are trying to help non violent offenders get access to college through the NJ STEP program. And today, I would like to announce our next steps in helping those battling the disease of drug addiction by improving the way we deliver these services. Right now there are numerous federal, state, and county government programs, providers, and nonprofit partners, who fund and deliver some form of adult addiction services. How to access those services can be difficult and overwhelming when confronted with the unintended bureaucracy of options. Contacting multiple agencies and trying to identify the right treatment is challenging enough, but even more so for individuals in crisis. If we are able to make it easier for individuals battling addiction and their loved ones to access the right services at the right time, we can save lives. This year, our administration will launch the first phase of a reform effort to make all of these services available from a single point of entry. There is no "wrong door" in this approach. Those faced with addiction will be able to make one phone call to access available services and resources anywhere in the state. Just one phone call to provide real time information, assess available treatment options, and connect them to the help they need right then and there. This is how good government is supposed to work. By coordinating all of our programs and services across state government that are designed to help those dealing with addiction allows us to maximize our resources, ensure dollars are not going to waste, and get real time information from our partners across the state. Just one phone call to connect with someone who can walk an individual through the options that best work for their recovery process. It's the smart way to make sure we don't have people stuck in a system utilizing services that don't actually work for them. Once this reform is underway, we will extend this same concept to those adults with mental illness. Planning for this has already begun. This coordinated approach builds on our commitment to rethink how government services are delivered so that we are being smarter, more efficient, and more targeted. Going back to 2010, we put in place a model to better connect populations most in need of assistance with the kind of care they actually need, whether seniors, people with disabilities, or adults with substance abuse or mental illness. We reformed the state's Medicaid program and created an innovative system that gives senior citizens and people with disabilities easier access to care and greater choice. Our whole emphasis has been to deliver the right level of service to the right person, in the right place. As a result, we've increased and improved the options of assistance and care provided in a home setting and in the community, while reducing our reliance on more traditional institutional care, whether in nursing homes or developmental centers. This approach has worked under Medicaid, improving services and holding down costs for seniors, those with developmental disabilities, and for all eligible citizens and families. Under my administration, New Jersey's Medicaid spending growth on these groups has trailed the national average, and has been cited as the second lowest in the region. We are also taking this model directly to our communities. Last fall we created the facing addiction task force, a 12 member team chaired by Pastor Joe Carter of Newark's New Hope Baptist Church and co chaired by former Governor Jim Mcgreevey to fight drug addiction by ending the stigma and focusing on treatment and prevention. I thank them for their willingness to step up and lead this fight. They have come forward with a one stop model for connecting comprehensive services to ex offenders battling addiction as they leave incarceration or drug court and reenter society. This is just smart government. By helping an individual connect the dots from treatment to temporary housing to employment and training services, we are helping them lay their own foundation for a successful re entry into society. In Newark, Paterson, Atlantic City, Toms River, Trenton, and Jersey City, a single physical location will be run by a non profit organization in coordination with our administration, local officials, and community partners. By directly connecting those who have suffered from addiction to the services they need at a most critical juncture, we are helping them avoid a cycle of dependency by transitioning them from government services to the workplace. This doesn't just reduce long term service costs to the state, but is the best way to ensure they become hopeful, happy, and productive members of our society. Now, of all the long term challenges we face, one of the largest and most immediate is our obligation to provide pension and health benefits for state and local employees. This is not just a New Jersey problem. This is a national problem. States across the country are struggling to fund critical programs because pension and health costs are eating up taxpayer dollars. We first took the lead to try and solve this problem in 2011 when a republican governor and a democratic legislature came together to go up against the entrenched special interests. It was hard. It was loud. It was the right thing to do. Together we defied the conventional wisdom and enacted historic reforms that reduce the cost to taxpayers by over $120 billion over the next three decades. This was a huge first step. Today, the health of the pension system is stronger than it was five years ago. In fact, gains have totaled over $35 billion, which is way above projections, thanks to our sound management and smart investment strategy. But the fact is that while we have been making up ground, the pension fund is underfunded because of poor decisions by governors and legislatures of both parties, over decades, not years. These sins of the past have made the system unaffordable. But we do not have the luxury to ignore this problem. We know this because even as our administration has contributed more money to the system than any in history, it is not enough. The pension fund's problem is a long term one. And it is related to every other program in state government. Right now the $90 billion unfunded liability for pensions and health benefits is three times the size of the annual state budget. Think of this way, in order to close the current shortfall in just the pension system alone every family in New Jersey would have to write a check for $12000. That is the nature of long term entitlements which grow faster than the economy, and in that regard our problem here in New Jersey is not that different from Washington's entitlement problem. For all of these reasons, last summer I appointed a bipartisan commission of experts, a pension and health benefits task force, to make recommendations for tackling the twin problems of pension and health benefit costs. I asked them to think outside the box, and they are hard at work. I thank the members of the commission, led by Tom Healy, a former assistant Secretary of the US Treasury, on their efforts and willingness to tackle this pressing issue. A long term solution and sustainable future for our pension and health benefit plans are difficult but worthy things to achieve. We took a historic first step in 2011. Let's make 2015 the year we finish the job. Now coming out of the last recession, America remains a country ill at ease. America's economy is growing, but it is not growing enough. New Jersey's economy is growing, but it is not growing enough. Last week's jobs report was good, but real wages declined. The economy is simply not as strong as it could be, or as it should be. We are a nation beset by anxiety. It is understandable. Economic growth is low by post war recovery standards. America's leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency. During this time of uncertainty it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain. And this culture of divisiveness and distrust has seeped into our communities and our neighborhoods. As I traveled the country over the last year, this anxiety was the most palpable emotion I saw and felt. I saw it on the streets of Chicago and felt it in the suburbs of Maryland. I heard it from farmers in Kansas and from teachers in Colorado. I felt it from veterans in Maine and from workers in Arkansas. But the wisest words came from an 82 year old woman in Florida. She grabbed my hand and asked me a simple, but powerful question: "What's happened to our country? We used to control events. Now events control us." But right here, in this great state, we have the tools to get back on track. We know that, time and again, economic growth has delivered the most good for the most people. And we know that the policies of lower taxes and less intrusive government have created higher economic growth and better paying jobs for our middle class. We know that a commitment to education at every level is another key to a better tomorrow. We just have to have the courage to fix those schools we know aren't working and to empower principals, teachers, parents, and students to reach for the sky; and the wisdom to invest in the schools, colleges, and universities that can take us there. We know that our ability to make these investments in education, infrastructure, our cities and our communities is dependent on our willingness to control the smothering costs of entitlements. We know these things as a people, yet too often in the past our leaders have failed to act on them and the result is a sense of drift. Let me be clear. We need to address this anxiety head on. We need to renew the spirit and the hopes of our state, our country and our people. A renewal of our commitment to the hard working families who are the backbone of our state. A renewal of our commitment to the simple belief that our people deserve better than a bloated national government that imposes costs on our states which suffocate our people. A renewal of our commitment to the ideal, and the hard work to make it happen,that New Jersey's best days can lie ahead. That we don't have to accept anything less. A renewal of our commitment to the belief that New Jersey and its people deserve better from us, those they have chosen to lead. We need a New Jersey renewal and an American renewal. I renew my commitment to New Jersey today to make the lives of our citizens more prosperous, more healthy, better educated and truly optimistic. So that when we stand here in one year, our today will be better than our yesterdays and our tomorrow will be filled with real opportunity. We may argue from time to time over the best means to get things done. That's the nature of public debate and I will always be willing to engage in it with you. But our goal, together, should be to make sure that New Jersey remains one place where a better life is possible, for us, for our children, and for their children, through determination, hard work, and a commitment to the greater good. There is no better example of what we can achieve if we put aside party and pettiness than the results we are seeing in Camden. A city devoid of hope five years ago A city riddled with violent crime five years ago A city beset by a corrupt and ineffective government five years ago A school system that failed Camden's families almost every day just five short years ago. Then an outstanding leader stepped forward for mayor. A county government stepped in to lead boldly. And I asked all of you to support a new vision for Camden. Did we just throw money at the problem as has been done before? No. We demanded partnership and accountability and we are getting results. Through the economic opportunity act of 2013 a city that has suffered from divestment for decades is now seeing a new tomorrow. $600 million of private investment in Camden in the last year alone. In a city suffering from epidemic crime, we acted boldly. We terminated the city police department and, partnering with the county, put a new metro division on the streets with 400 officers for the same price we were paying for 260. The results? Murder down 51%. Firearm assaults down by 1/3. All violent crime down 22%. Police are working with neighborhood groups to bring calm and peace across the city. In Camden schools, we partnered with the local groups to bring new leadership to the schools and a renewed accountability to the classroom. The Urban Hope Act has expanded opportunity and new schools are being built once again in Camden in a public/ private partnership. Hope and optimism are up,fear of failure is down. In Camden's downtown, a new medical school and new investment by Rutgers University is helping to bring bright new citizens to Camden's neighborhoods. No one could have believed it was possible five years ago. Today, it is happening because we put action and results ahead of politics, partisanship and a shared failed history. So this year, let us recommit to action, To creating the conditions for growth To preparing our children for a better future To addressing our long term problems And to valuing every life. That is our job as public servants. And that should be our common agenda for the year ahead. I believe in a New Jersey renewal which can help lead to an American renewal both in every individual home and in homes around the world. I pray today that you will join me in that renewal as so many of you in this chamber and in this state have done before over the last five years. I am proud to be your governor and I will never stop fighting for our New Jersey renewal. God bless the great state of Iowa. I want to thank each and every one of you for being here. I want to thank Citizens United and my good friend Steve King for putting this on. You know Steve and I spent all week in Washington, DC so it is great to be back in America. We're living in remarkable times. Just a couple of weeks ago, walking down the hall of the Capitol, I ran into a janitor carrying a screwdriver, who was coming to change the sign on Harry Reid's door. And Iowa played a big part in that by sending us Joni Ernst. And I for one sure am glad that we have a farmer as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Today is the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's passing. Churchill stood as a lion in winter, a voice against the darkness that was sweeping the globe. And I'll tell you 50 years later we are facing threats every bit as ominous. And today, like then, we need the clarity of thought and voice and action that Churchill provided. One of the very first acts President Obama did upon being elected was sending Churchill's bust back to the UK, and I think that foreshadowed everything that was to come the next six years. Now I'll tell you I'm very happy that here with me today is my wife Heidi. Heidi is an incredible mom, she's a fantastic businesswoman, and she is my very best friend in the entire world. And you know we're blessed to have two little girls at home. Caroline who's six, Catherine who's four. And I'll tell you Heidi and I are here for the same reason that all of y'all are here. Because we look at what's happening in this country and we fear for our children; we fear for our grandchildren. So what I want to talk to you about today is reigniting the miracle of America. This country was built on an extraordinary miracle. The miracle of America began with a revolutionary idea, which is that our rights, they don't come from government, they come from God Almighty. And the Constitution, it serves as Jefferson said, as chains to bind the mischief of government. This country was built on incredible opportunity that if you're a single mom waiting tables you can do anything; if you're a teenage immigrant washing dishes you can do anything. There's been no country in the history of the world that has allowed so many millions with nothing to come and seek the unlimited dreams of their potential. And third, the miracle of America has been American exceptionalism, that we are the indispensable nation, a voice, a clarion voice for freedom and we will back down to no face of tyranny. Now how do we bring that back. How do we reignite the miracle of America? It is the most important cause that unifies us together and Iowa believes in the miracle of America. Number one we champion jobs and economic growth and opportunity. We bring back and environment where small businesses are growing. are creating opportunity; we get the senseless obstacles from Washington out of the way. That means tax reform and regulatory reform. It means sending the locusts of the EPA back to Washington. I was once out in West Texas and I said, you know the thing about folks from the EPA is unlike locusts you can't use pesticide against them, and an old farmer looked at me and said, wanna bet? And the most important regulatory reform we can do is we need to repeal every word of Obamacare. We need tax reform. And the most important tax reform we can do is we need to abolish the IRS. We need a simple flat tax that's fair, that every American can fill out his or her taxes on a post card. There are 110000 employees at the IRS. We need to padlock that building and put every one of those 110000 on our Southern border. Now I say that somewhat tongue in cheek, but think about it for a second. Imagine you had traveled thousands of miles through Central America, through the heat. You're swimming across the Rio Grande, and the first thing you see is 110000 IRS agents. You'd turn around and go home too. The second key to reigniting the miracle of America is we need to defend our constitutional rights. Every single one of them. The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Tenth Amendment. You know no liberty has been more under assault in recent years than religious liberty. Whether it is the federal government going after Hobby Lobby, a Christian company, or going after the Little Sisters of the Poor. And by the way, here's a real good rule of thumb: if you're litigating against nuns, as the Obama administration is, you've probably done something wrong. You know I'm sorry to say one of the most graphic threats to religious liberty occurred in my home town of Houston, where the City of Houston subpoenad five pastors and demanded of those pastors hand over your sermons, hand over your sermon notes. Now let me tell you a story that's going to lift up your hearts. When that happened, that Wednesday, I decided we were going to try to bring together a group of pastors to have a rally in defense of religious liberty. So Heidi and I, we're members of First Baptist in Houston, we called our pastor, Pastor Greg Mott. And I said Pastor, you've seen what's happened with the subpoenas. He said, oh yeah Ted, I've been praying about it all morning. And I said well listen, we want to hold a rally; we want to bring pastors together; we want to do it tomorrow, Thursday at 11 am. And I wanted to ask you, can we do it at the church; would you be willing to host it at the church? And Pastor Greg begins laughing. And he said, you know Ted, God sometimes moves in ways we cannot understand long before we have any awareness of it. He said a month ago, God put it on my heart to begin praying for our city, and a month ago he said, I reached out to pastors across the city of Houston and invited them to come to my office to pray for our city. He said we have 50 pastors from around the city coming to my office tomorrow at 10 am. I'll tell you it took both our breaths away. And so the next morning I joined those pastors at 10 am; we spent an hour on our knees in prayer for the city. We then went down to a rally with over 50 pastors from across racial lines, across ethnic lines, across denominational lines. Heck, we even had First Baptists and Second Baptists. And that ain't easy. And we stood in that rally together and we said, Caeser has no jurisdiction over the pulpit. And when you subpoena one pastor, you subpoena every pastor. Now I'll tell you believers all over Texas, all over the country lifted up the situation. Conservatives spoke out, and the heat and pressure was so great that the city folded under and withdrew the subpoena. We've got to defend our constitutional liberties. And third, we need to restore America's leadership in the world. Over the past six years we have seen the fruits of the Obama Clinton foreign policy of receding from leadership in the world. Leading from behind doesn't work. Just a couple of weeks ago we were horrified at the terrorist attack in the streets of Paris, and then horrified again when over 40 world leaders came in solidarity and yet missing from that rally, graphically, was the United States of America. You cannot fight and win a war on radical Islamic terrorism if you're unwilling to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism. I would note that the depraved men who flew the planes into the twin towers and the Pentagon and to that field in Pennsylvania, they weren't a bunch of ticked off Presbyterians. I think some of the Presbyterians like that. And you know Paris also illustrates that a big ocean doesn't mean we're protected from radical Islamic terrorism. It's one of the reasons I've joined with Steve King and Chuck Grassley to introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act that says that if an American takes up arms with ISIS, he forfeits his or her citizenship. Now Iowa, Iowa plays a unique and special role in the political process. The men and women gathered here today and across the state, you have a responsibility that you take very seriously to scrutinize any candidate for national office, to look them in the eyes and to hold them to account. I've got to say a lot of people have the reaction: I don't trust politicians. And that's worth applauding because I agree with it. You know in a Republican primary every candidate's going to come in front of you and say, I'm the most conservative guy to ever live. Gosh darn it, hoo diddly, I'm conservative. Well you know what, talk is cheap. The word tells them you shall know them by their fruit. And one of the most important roles that the men and women in this room, the men and women in Iowa will play is to look each candidate in the eye and say, don't talk, show me. If you say you support liberty, show me where you stood up and fought for it. If you say you support religious liberty, show me where you stood up and fought for it. If you say you oppose Obamacare, show me where you stood up and fought against it. If you say you oppose the president's unconstitutional executive amnesty, show me where you stood up and fought. If you say you support life and you support marriage, show me where you stood up and fought. If you say you'll stand up to the Washington establishment, the career politicians of both parties that have gotten us in this mess, show me where you've stood up and fought. If you say you oppose Common Core, show me where you've stood up and fought. And if you say you stand with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, show me where you've stood up and fought. Together, we need to reassemble the Reagan coalition. We need to unify, we need to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Republican women and Reagan Democrats and young people. We need to bring together a coalition of Americans who want to believe again in the miracle of America. Now some might say, this is hard; this is really hard. The media tells us it can't be done. The media says give up, abandon hope, go on home. But you know each of us has seen miracles every day. We've seen miracles in our own lives, in our own families. Many of y'all here know my father, Pastor Rafael Cruz. My dad has been my hero my entire life. When he fled Cuba as a teenager with nothing after being imprisoned and tortured he was full of hope and opportunity. But let me tell you a different aspect of his story you may not have heard. Which is he and my mother moved to Canada in the oil and gas business. The Canucks in the room they're giving us some love. And I'll tell you, when I was born, when I was a little boy neither of my parents knew Christ. Both of them were living fast lives, both of them were drinking too much. And when I was three years old my dad decided he didn't want to be married any more. He didn't want to be a dad to his three year old son. So my father got on a plane and he flew back to Houston. And back in Houston he was working in the oil and gas business when a friend and colleague invited him to a Bible study and invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his life to Jesus. And it transformed his heart and he went to the airport and he bought a plane ticket and he flew back to Calgary, and he flew back to my mother and he flew back to me. You know some people ask if faith is real. I can tell you first hand in my family and my life if it were not for the redeeming love, if it were not for faith in Jesus Christ I would have been raised by a single mom without the love of my father in the household. Men and women all throughout here have experienced miracles just like that in our lives, transforming. The Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Compared to that the challenges we face in this country are nothing. From the beginning of this country, God's providential blessing has been on the United States of America. When we stood up against the mightiest army on the face of the Earth and won a revolution as a rag tag bunch of colonists, it was only with God's blessing that we did so. When we survived the horrible Civil War that ripped us apart to expunge the original sin of slavery, it was only with God's blessing that we came back and were stitched together as a nation. When we stood with Winston Churchill to defeat the Nazis and the scourge of evil, it was only with God's blessing that we saved freedom on this planet. And when President Reagan stood before the Brandenberg Gate and said Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall, it was only with God's grace and blessing that we won the Cold War. We have done it before over and over again, and we can do it again. We can come together. And the answer, the reason I am hopeful, the reason I am optimistic is because of each and every one of you. The answer is the grassroots, is the American people. We are working to build a grassroots army all across this country. The answer will not come from Washington; it will only come from the American people. So I would ask every one of you that has your cell phone, I would ask you on your cell phone to text the word "Constitution" to the number 33733. I'm going to give you that again. The word "Constitution" to the number 33733. What we're working to do is to bring together that same coalition of men and women across Iowa, across this country to say we do not accept losing this country. We will together reignite the miracle of America; we will together bring back that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America. Thank you and God bless you. Thank you. I'll actually be 44 in about three weeks, but I feel 45, so it must be all the airplane travel. Thank you for having me. It is actually an honor to be here. Before I stood here a moment ago, we were discussing the long history of this organization and some of the people that have spoken here in the past, and so it's an honor to be included now in that list. No matter what happens from here on out, I'll always be on that list, and it's an honor to be with you. I do want to talk to you about the future of our country. I do want to talk to you about the 21st century. And I want to talk to you about it by reminding you, first of all, of who America has been for the last two centuries. Probably the best way to do that is to remember that for almost all of human history, the vast majority of people that have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth. In essence, they lived in societies where their future was dependent on what their parents did before them, no matter how hard they worked, or how much they tried. My parents lived like that. They were born to poor families in Cuba. They had no connections to wealth or to power, and so in search of a better life they came to America in 1956. Here in America, they never became rich and they never became famous, yet they lived meaningful and successful lives, because they found stable jobs, because they were able to retire with dignity, and because they were able to leave all four of their children better off than themselves. So why was that possible? How did two people, born into poor families with very limited education, how were they able to achieve a life better than the one they were born into? And the answer is, because they had the blessing of being able to live in America during the American century. Our identity as a land of equal opportunity actually began in our founding the Declaration of Independence that says that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator, not by their government, not by their laws, not by their Constitution, by their creator, with the right to life, and to liberty, and to pursue happiness. And then in the early years of the 19th century a still developing America had to make a choice. It could either embrace the promise of the future, it could embrace industrialization, or it could be left behind by history. And that generation of Americans, at the turn of the 19th century, they embraced industrialization, with all of its promise and with all of its disruptions. And less than 100 years later, America was the single most powerful economy on the planet. The 20th century became the American century, a century with an economy that gave birth to what we now know as the American dream, and a century where not once, but twice, this great nation was called upon to help the world save it from evil. But now, in the early years of this new century, a growing number of people are starting to doubt whether we're still that kind of country. And the reason why they feel that way is because of the way their lives are being led. There are families that are working as hard as they ever have, sometimes at the same jobs they've had forever, but they're living paycheck to paycheck, one unexpected expense away from disaster. There are young couples and entrepreneurs who are trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of their home, but they can't deal with the government rules and the regulations and the evisceration of small banks and lack of access to capital. There are students who did everything that we told them they needed to do to succeed. We told them, Go to college. Get a degree, and they did that, and now they've graduated with a mountain of student loan debt, and degrees that do not lead to jobs. And around the world every single day the news says that evil is winning and America seems less capable than ever of doing anything to stop it. Why is this happening? It is not, as some believe, the inevitable decline of a once great nation. It is not, as some believe, the normal course of history, that we were once on top, and now we are destined to decline like the great nations before us. That is not what's happening. What is happening is the direct result of our leaders; of leaders who are both trapped in the past when it comes to economic policies, but have also forgotten fundamental and timeless truths about the nature of the world. Today, we face a fundamental economic transformation, bigger and faster than the Industrial Revolution was in the 19th century. Because of globalization, jobs and prosperity are directly tied to our ability to compete internationally, and yet we have leaders that continue to want to tax us and regulate us and borrow us into an uncompetitive position, and today America is not as globally competitive as it should be. Because of technology and automation, the nature of work has changed. Many of the jobs that once sustained our middle class are now done by machines, or they've gone overseas, or they don't pay what they once did in comparison to the cost of living. But we have outdated leaders that want to continue to pour money into an outdated 20th century higher education system that costs too much and leaves too many of our people unprepared to compete in the 21st century economy. And despite all of these changes that are going on economically, there are still fundamental truths that apply, and one of them is that the price of a lack of American leadership is global chaos and danger. And so now, just as we did two centuries ago, our nation stands at a hinge moment in our history, where we must decide once again, do we want to embrace the future or be left behind by history? We cannot embrace this future led by people who are trapped in yesterday. The ideas of the 20th century, even the ones that worked back then, sometimes don't work anymore, and the bad ideas of the 20th century are disastrous in the 21st. Turning the page is what we need to do as a nation and as a society, and it begins by putting in place policies that make us globally competitive again, with a very simple goal: we want America to be the best place in the world to work, to start a business, or to invent things. And that's why we need regulatory reform. That's why we need tax reform. That's why we need to repeal the disastrous healthcare law, and that's why we need to bring our debt under control. If we do those four things, if we do those four things, we will once again be globally competitive. We will once again be the best place in the world to invest and innovate and create jobs and opportunity for other people. The second thing we have to do is we must reform our outdated system of higher education. For starters, we have to start graduating people from high school ready to work as welders, as plumbers, as machinists. These are important trades that we have shortages of. These are good paying jobs, and somehow our society has stigmatized them, and we no longer prepare 16, 17, and 18 year olds to enter the workplace immediately or soon thereafter. We need to create flexibility for working parents and working families to be able to go back to school and acquire a degree or a certificate that allows them to improve their employment opportunities, so that the receptionist at a law firm can become a paralegal, so that the home health aide making $9 an hour can become a dental hygienist making $60000 a year. The problem is if you have to work full time and raise a family today, you can't drop everything and go to a traditional school for two to four years. You need flexible programs that are cost effective, affordable, and allow you to study online, on weekends, and on your own pace. We also need to reform traditional higher education. There will always be a place for the traditional college degree, but we cannot continue to graduate people with a mountain of debt and degrees that do not lead to jobs, which is why I've proposed a bipartisan bill that says, straightforward, before you take out a student loan, that school has to tell you how much people make when they graduate with that degree from that school, so people can decide whether it's worth borrowing $20000 or $30000 or $40000 to pursue a particular degree. And yet as we embrace all of these opportunities and change our policies for this new era, we still have to understand the fundamental truth about global evens, and the fundamental truth is that there is no replacement for America on the world stage. When America gives up its leadership role in the world, chaos inevitably follows, and that's what we see everywhere in the world today. Only America can rally our Asian allies in the Asia Pacific region to confront China's blatant efforts to basically gain control of the most important shipping lane in the world, the South China Sea. Only America can reinvigorate NATO to prevent Vladimir Putin from re drawing the map of Europe in the aftermath of the Cold War. Only America can work with our allies in the Middle East to confront both Iran's ambitions, and also the rise of radical jihad, and only America can provide the support that Israel needs in order to survive as a peaceful Jewish state. Today, in the absence of that leadership, all of those regions of the world find themselves in chaos. Today in the 21st century global leadership isn't just about national security anymore; it's also about prosperity. Because you and I are 4 percent of the world's population. We Americans are 4 to 5 percent of the world's population. There is only so much prosperity we can create if all we do is sell things to each other. We need there to be millions of people on this planet that can afford to buy the services we offer, the goods we manufacture, and the products we invent, but you cannot have global prosperity without global stability, and you cannot have global stability without strong American leadership. So I guess the way I would wrap this up is by reminding us now that for over two centuries, every generation of Americans has had to answer a very fundamental question: what kind of country do you want America to be? And for over two centuries, facing difficult and different challenges, each generation has said, We want America to remain special. Now the time has come for this generation of Americans to answer the exact same question. In the face of these rapid and disruptive changes, we are called to confront the challenges, and to embrace the opportunities of this exciting new era. We should be proud of our history, but yesterday is over, and it is never going to come back. Before us now is the exciting opportunity to usher in the greatest chapter in the story of America. For if we do the things that I've outlined, if we become globally competitive again, if we equip our people with the skills they need for the 21st century, if we once again re exercise American leadership on the global stage, the 21st century won't just be as good as the 20th century, it will be better. The American dream won't just survive, it'll reach more people and change more lives. And this 21st century will also be an American century. If we fail, we will be the first Americans to leave the next generation worse off. It reminds me, you asked about the state of this election. Well, I believe with all my heart that this next election will not simply be a choice about what political party will govern the country, or what laws we're going to pass. I believe this next election is a generational choice about the very identity of our nation. I entered this race with no sense of entitlement to the office of the presidency. On the contrary, America doesn't owe me anything, but I have a debt to America that I will never ever be able to repay. America isn't just the country I was born in; it's literally the nation that changed the history of my family. After his mother died, when he was nine years old, my father went to work in the streets of Havana with his father, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life. My mother was one of seven girls raised by a disabled father who always struggled to provide for his children. When my parents were young, they had dreams too, but because they were born into poor families with no political connections, those dreams never had a chance. So they came here, to the one place on earth where their dreams could have the opportunity to turn into reality. Here in America, my father became a bartender. My mother was a maid. She was a stock clerk at K Mart. She was a cashier. As I told you at the outset, they never made it big. They were never rich. They were never famous, but they were successful, because they achieved what has come to be known as the American dream. And they didn't just live in America. My parents became Americans. My mother said she realized that she had become an American on that horrible day in November of 1963, when President Kennedy was killed and she wept, because her president had been slain. My grandfather, who was born in 1899 before there were even airplanes in the sky, told me once when I was a boy that he knew he had become an American on that night in 1969 when on television he watched a man step foot on the moon. And he thought to himself, We Americans, we can do anything. For my father, it probably wasn't one moment. I think for my father it was the realization that just a few decades removed from poverty and despair, he was able, he, an immigrant, with little education or money, was able to have a stable job, own a home, retire with security, and make possible for his children all the things that were never possible for him. My point is that whether we are Americans by birth or Americans by choice, every single one of us has a debt to this country we will never be able to repay, because every single one of us inherited from those who came before us an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation of Americans to do its part, not just to achieve the American dream for ourselves, but to make it possible for those who are trying to do for their children what our parents did for us. For the single mother who sacrifices and struggles so that her children will never have to go through what she did. For the workers on the late shift who go to school after they get out of work because they want a better life for themselves and for their families. For the young couple who's trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of their home. In their hands is the future of our country. Because if their dreams become impossible, we have just become another country, no different, no better, and no longer special. But if their dreams are alive, then the 21st century will be the greatest era in our history. It will also be an American century. And I hope that we will take up the calling of our time, because if we do, future generations will look back at us and say that like those who came before us, we did our part, and because we did, because we did, the American miracle lived on. Because we did, the 21st century was also an American century, and because we did, we left for our children what Americans always leave for their children, the single greatest nation in the history of the world. Thank you for the chance to talk to you about this. I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you very much. 
Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands. So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this. And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time. When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically. The US has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people. It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken. So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19, and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said, and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, Don't hit Iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league. We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love, they're great, all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers. And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it. Last week, I read 2300 Humvees, these are big vehicles, were left behind for the enemy. 2000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them. Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product, a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero. Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate. And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5. Don't believe it. That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs. But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense. Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare. Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster. And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website. I have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website. Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us, believe me, to the promised land. They will not. As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know, Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it? I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us. But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches. I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job. And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in 2016, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to, I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now. We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be, and, and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully, they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully. Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now. Now, our country needs, our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal. We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. And we also need a cheerleader. You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit. He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader. He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that. But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite. We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. We need, we need somebody, we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough. You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again. So ladies and gentlemen. I am officially running. for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be, they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money. Right now, think of this: We owe China $1 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better. How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? I'm going to tell you, thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons. Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator. He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have. Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But. So we need people, I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work. So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again. But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything, everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete. So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, What's your problem? He said, You know, I make great product. And I said, I know. I know that because I buy the product. He said, I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it. I said, Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this? He said, Yeah, they do it all the time with other people. I said, They send it back? Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them. Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there. Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing. Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for, I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable. I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, Oh, you don't like China? No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much, it's like, it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders. They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place. We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly. Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country, we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port. They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China. And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico. So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it. But I have another one, Ford. So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people. All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good. Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company. So I announced that I'm running for president. I would.. one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in, and I wouldn't even use, you know, I have, I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they're not good. But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well. But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border. And you say to yourself, How does that help us, right? How does that help us? Where is that good? It's not. So I would say, Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it. Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford. And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us. So under President Trump, here's what would happen: The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool. And he'll say, Please, please, please. He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, No interest. Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, Sorry, fellas. No interest, because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I. And by the way, I'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country. So, because we got to make the country rich. It sounds crass. Somebody said, Oh, that's crass. It's not crass. We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems. We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete. We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. But here's what's going to happen: After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the, the donors and by the lobbyists, and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero, I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. Please reconsider, I'll say no. He'll say, Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico. That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice. There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example. Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say we're gonna protect. What are we doing? They've got nothing but money. If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us. And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out, and they kept our equipment. They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be, we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff. But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone. And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now, it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, Is he intelligent? Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question. How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna, how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible. But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders. There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people. So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence. Somebody said, thank you, darlin'. Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? Great. Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. So the reporter said to me the other day, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you? I said, I don't know. I said, I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person. But, I said, This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle. They're right about that, but I'm doing it. Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth. So I said, That's OK. I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. I started off, thank you, I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said, and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot. But he used to say, Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it. I said, I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it. And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals, the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing. But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks. So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. I've employed, I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything. So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't use extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion. So I said, No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets. So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate. It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world. And I have assets, big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected, 9 billion 240 million dollars. And I have liabilities of about $500 million. That's long term debt, very low interest rates. In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion? I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it. But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of net worth, not assets, not, a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets, Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York, many other places all over the world. So the total is $873754000. Now I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not. I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking. We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years, you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion. According to the economists, who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying, that $24 trillion, we're very close, that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon. So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare. I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find, within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around. I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened, it's up in the prison area, my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting. I said, Very interesting. So protect the Second Amendment. End, end Common Core. Common Core should, it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end education has to be local. Rebuild the country's infrastructure. Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought. I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad. You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, DC We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after, or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it. Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built. So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40 year old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw. You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost. Renegotiate our foreign trade deals. Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful. And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important. Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. That's so nice. Isn't he a great guy. He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it. It's just not fair. And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party. Also, also the people of Iowa. They have something in common. Hard working people. They want to work, they want to make the country great. I love the people of Iowa. So that's the way it is. Very simple. With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job. The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused. Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible. In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray. Very simple. Politicians are all talk, no action. They are all talk and no action. And it's constant; it never ends. And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican. And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians. Because they let the president get away with absolute murder. You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to,. Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens. You look at Obamacare. A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in 2016 and it is going to be a disaster. People are closing up shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy. He said, I have more accountants than I have patients. And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business. And he was very successful guy. But it's happening more and more. Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website. I have many websites, many, many websites. They're all over the place. But for $10, okay? Now everything about Obamacare was a lie. It was a filthy lie. And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted? Does anyone do anything? And what are the Republican politicians doing about it? He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect. You can keep your plan. And you've all heard that hundreds of times. That's like the real estate location, location. I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location. But you have heard this about Obamacare. And it's disgraceful. It's a big, fat, horrible lie. Your deductibles are going through the roof. You're not going to get, unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage. And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore. So it's a real, real disaster. And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare. And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it. Now, we have to build a fence. And it's got to be a beauty. Who can build better than Trump? I build; it's what I do. I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings. Fences are easy, believe me. I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border. They're walking. The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country. It is so terrible. It is so unfair. It is so incompetent. And we don't have the best coming in. We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks. You can certainly have terrorists. You can certainly have Islamic terrorists. You can have anything coming across the border. We don't do anything about it. So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border. Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it. Benghazi. Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi. Everything is Benghazi. What happens? Nothing. IRS, e mails. I get sued all the time, okay. I run a big business. You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful. I have done so many deals. Almost all of them have been tremendously successful. You'll see that when I file my statements. I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay. But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president. Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many, Look, Obama, what did he do? No deal. He never did a deal. He did one deal. A house. And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay. He got away with murder. But I can tell you, e mails. IRS, the e mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost. If you were in my world you would know that e mails can't be lost; they can't be lost. So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e mails are? They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it. Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great. But they talk about it. And then you have a president that does an executive order. Nobody even heard of an executive order. He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders. Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment, which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that, why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier. Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it. We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed. So we have to do something. Jobs. China. I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese. One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it. And I know them. And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with. We can't believe how stupid your leaders are. They tell me that. Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not. But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much, goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries. The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation. I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing. They are devaluing down to nothing. And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete. And they're getting away with it. And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it. But you watch this devaluation of all of it. I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing. And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good. You know it's one of those things, sounds good. Be very careful. Be very careful. Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing. They have it set. Don't forget another thing. China became the number one economic power a year ago. That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen. It was absolutely unthinkable. So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq. We got nothing. They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us. Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us. We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS. By the way, you know how they formed. They took the oil. And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump, there are some of you, have I been saying for four years, keep the oil. So now ISIS has the oil. And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take. So we get nothing. We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have. I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people. And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military. But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast. We have incompetent people. They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing. It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security. because I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security. I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid. Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security. And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue. It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things. Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons. We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast. We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We can't do it. Can't do it. We cannot let that happen. You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria. We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria. Think of this. We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government. Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay. But think of it; think of it. ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall. There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear. Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles. You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable. The power. And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens. We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there. We're trying to do the right thing. We have leadership, again, no leadership respects us. You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find. The same thing is happening there. And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals. And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals. They're taking it out. Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals. So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker. It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country. If we don't, The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed. Bridges are collapsing all over the country. The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai. I go to various different places. I go to China. They are building a bridge on every corner. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff. They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen. They are building airports in Qatar, which they like to say cutter but I've always said Qatar so I'll keep it Qatar what the hell. But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen. And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes. The place is falling apart. You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart. And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt. So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place. This is inside, not outside. And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen. In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor. I said it's not an honor; they're just smart. But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad, I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails. You know the guard rails. The ones that sort of go like this that are always bent, rusted and horrible. Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes. Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years. Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works. Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening. Somebody made a lot of money on that. They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again. We have to rebuild our country. And we have a long way to go. We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money. Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it. We owe it to other countries. They're the ones that hold the debt. And then we give them money. We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies. I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know, No American company comes to see and comes to bid. It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them. What are we doing; why aren't they paying us? Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing? I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea. You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea. Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on? Now, we have a very important election coming up. We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people. Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details. We have some good people. It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed. He failed. I mean I liked him. Look, like him, dislike him, the 47 percent statement that he made, that's not going away. The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away. What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time. It's not fair because it was a long t, That doesn't work. But more importantly, he choked. Something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won. And let me tell you something. That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal. I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it. Or a golfer that can't sink the three footer to win the tournament. And there are many of them. Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that. You can't give somebody another chance, because actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president. I really do. I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true. So you can't have Romney. He choked. You can't have Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing, You know they copied it. I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing. But I said it. I was the one that said it first, and I mean it. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that. But he's totally in favor of Common Core. He's very, very weak on immigration. Don't forget, remember his statement, they come for love. I say, what? Come for love? You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals. They're coming for love? They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love. And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama. I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama. because Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months. And then he appointed Justice Roberts. And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts. And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes. So you can't have Jeb Bush. And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win. So Mitt and, you just can't have those two. That's it. That's it. It's so simple. So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important. And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters. And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet. He is reading it. I mean give me a break. Everything is read. You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk. And that's what we ended up getting, the king of teleprompters. But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing. No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that. But we have to do something about these teleprompters. But in looking at these situations, I built an incredible company. And you'll see that. An incredible company; a wonderful company. I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing. And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix. We have such great potential. So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in: creating jobs; defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists, and you have to do that; reducing the budget deficit, so important, have to do it; securing our Southern border, and I mean seriously securing it; stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere; saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it; repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country. And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody. And everybody can be covered. I'm not saying leave 50 percent of the people out. Everybody can be c, This plan is just a basic disaster. Nobody knows. As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is; fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports. And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump. I just got the best hotel in North America. I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one. I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress. Right on Penn., The Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama. Do you believe that? And everybody wanted it. So, I can't believe it myself. But it's going to be fantastic; and so many other things. I know what needs to be done to make America great again. We can make this country great again. The potential is enormous. And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you. We have so many problems in this country. We'll talk about a few of them. And we'll celebrate because ultimately, we're going to have victory. We're going to have victory. This is a movement that's happening. I had a lawyer come up to see me a little while ago that said Mr. Trump, I've been doing this for 35 years and never seen what happened here. I got a call from a writer from The New York Times. I have great respect for The New York Times. And called up, I know. I hear that. OK. It's a good story, not a bad story. And he said could I ask you a question? I said what? Very powerful writer, actually. He said how does it feel? How does what feel? He said what you've done has never ever been done before. You've dominated. You have taken over the polls. You know, on television, on FOX and CNN, they call it all Trump all the time. Can you believe it? All trump all the time. And by the way, their ratings are through the roof. If they weren't, they wouldn't put me on. I'll be honest. It's a simple formula in entertainment and television. If you get good ratings, if you get good ratings and these aren't good, these are monster, then you're going to be in all the time even if you have nothing to say. If you come up with a cure for a major, major, horrendous disease and if you don't get ratings, they don't bother even reporting it. It's very simple business. It's very simple. So we've gone on, we've had a lot of fun and now it's time to really start because this is going to happen, I'm telling you, I'm not going anymore. Somebody said today. We're not going anywhere. We are not going anywhere. Somebody said today you've done so well, you don't have to go any further. I said are you crazy? You know what? The writer the Times told me, he said it's been amazing what you've done. I said but I haven't won. We haven't won anything. What if I won? I'm having fun and all, but I haven't won. There's been no victory. He said it doesn't matter. What you've done is incredible. You have won. I said you're wrong, unless I win it's been a waste of time for me, I'll be honest. A total waste of time. I really mean that, too. We should have won, thank you, he said you will win. We should have won last time. Mitt Romney let us down. I mean, he let us down. He let us down. You know, one of the things that I'm really happy about, I'm surging, they said. Can you believe this one? I'm surging with women. Can you believe it? I have such respect for women. I cherish women. I'm going to take such good care of women's health care issues, you won't even believe it, but I'm surging with women. One of the things coming out, I'm watching television and they said Trump is surging with women. I said really? That's amazing. You know, it's incredible. I'll make like statements because, you know, Carly is giving me a little bit of a hard time even though her poll numbers are horrible. She's the one. She was another one. She is surging. Ben is, everybody is surging but me. Hilary is not surging, I tell you that. They are not saying, thank you. Hilary is not surging. Look, I like Carly and I like Ben and I like many of the people that I'm running against. I mean, many of these people are terrific people, but nobody is going to be able to do the job that I'm going to do. Nobody. They won't. They won't. Don't forget, I love these people in back of me. But they won't. I mean, what I do is I do deals. I deal. I have tremendous energy, tremendous to a point where it's almost ridiculous when you think about it. But we need somebody with great energy, with great passion, with great deal making skills. And we need a closer. We need closers. We don't have closers. We just don't have closers. And honestly, they are not deal people. I'll tell you they are good at raising money for their packs or whatever they holding. Probably, they are not supposed to do that but most of them are doing anyway. It's illegal as hell, but I think they are doing it anyway. You notice they have money in the pack but they don't have hard money, but the pack has given them, I say what is going on over here? How come I can't talk to anybody? And again, I have to tell you this, and I want to have your opinion. So I'm self funding I told you. But if I took hundreds of millions, I tell you what, I could have $200 million so fast. If I took that, would you people object if I promise not to do anything from the people I took it from? No? I had a group in Iowa, actually, they were much more vocal about this one issue. And they stood up, no, no, the place, I mean, I realize how important it is, putting your own money in because I'm telling people that Jeb, nice guy, really a nice guy. Jeb is more popular than one person I know. But all of them. I don't want to go through the names. They have money put up in packs or hard money, wherever the money is, believe me, I was the king. I was the king. You know, I was the white haired, no, blonde haired, let's say blonde. But, I was the blonde head. I was perfect. I was the ultimate. I was the ultimate sort of insider. I put up money. They loved me. But then when I said I'm running, they all looked at me like the RNC, Reince is a great guy but it took him a little while because they looked at me like you're not supposed to be doing that. You're supposed to be putting up money. And if you need something in two years, three years, five years, they will do whatever you want. And what happened is I know the system I think better than anybody. I know the tax system. Look, taxes. Who knows better than me? We're going to reduce taxes. We're going to make the hedge fund, any hedge fund guys it would be mostly, you got good seats. Are there any hedge fund guys in this room? If there are, you should probably leave right now. But I have a friend in the hedge fund business, not really a friend. Not actually a nice guy, but it be goof representing us, I will tell you. Because by the time I finish he might not have much of a hedge fund. But I said what did you make last year? He said about $250 million. This is serious. I said, oh, that's a lot of money. What did you pay in taxes? He goes, Don, practically nothing. That was a couple years ago. I never forgot it. The other day he calls me up because he heard me talk about hedge fund guys are going to pay up. And he call up the other day. I was only kidding, you know, when I said that or sort of it. He doesn't know what to do. The truth is they will do just fine. They will do just fine because we'll make the country so successful, they will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. But we got to lower taxes for a lot of people. Corporations paying far too much, far too much, middle income people are being decimated, they are being decimated. I mean, we have a group of 200 guys but the middle income in this country is being decimated and we're going to change it. We're going to change it. So I'll be announcing over the next three or so weeks, I'll be announcing, I think a great tax plan. I know the tax code. I know everything about it, probably as well as anybody, there is, right? And we are going to be doing something that's going to be really pro, growth, really reduction in taxes. We're going to get the $2 trillion that's in other countries, we're going to get it back. No, we're going to get it back. And you know, you have corporate inversion. Does anybody know what that means? You know, in the old days people might leave New York for Texas or they may go from New Jersey to Florida or whatever. It's not that way anymore. Now they go from this country to other countries, and they go for two reasons, lower taxes, lower labor, but lower taxes. You have countries that want to charge them nothing. So they take these companies and these guys, they make a fortune, they have no real loyalty in many cases. They have no real loyalty to the United States. They want to show good profit and loss. So they take and go to another country. And all of a sudden their numbers look good. And they can't bring their money back in. And by the way for two and a half, three years, I have seen every politician agrees we should lower the tax on bringing money because it's so onerous that nobody in this room would bring that money back. Everybody says it for two and a half years, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody, they can't make a deal. They can't make a deal. We have a government that's really messed up because we don't have a leader at the top. A right leader could get it done. The right leader will get it done and you will see numbers like you've never seen before. I actually believe that and we're in trouble. You know, I've made the statement and I've said this before, the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. I made that statement. And I'll tell you what happens and it happens a lot. The other day I went home and I said to my wife, what's wrong? Oh, darling, you were very tough. What? What did I do? Of course, it's live television. She said you said the American dream is dead. I said no, I said the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. She said no, you didn't. You just said it's dead. So I turn on television, it's wonderful to record this and see it ten hours later. I turn on television and me standing in this big crowd, the American dream is dead. I said, oh. Again, the dishonest media. I went ballistic. I was so angry. But the American dream is going to be better. I tell you what? We can make it better than ever before. We can do, I mean, we're in Texas. We can do things with oil and gas that will be unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Try sending your oil outside of the boundaries of the United States. How ridiculous. And we're sitting on top because of technology, we can be the number one energy producer in the world right here in the United States. But we have our laws, we have everything is wrong. And I have so many friends in the energy business, they are great people, they are working, they are not as rich as they were about two months ago, but these are minor details. They will be fine. But we can do things with energy that will be so, so incredible, which is great for Texas but great for the country. It's great for the country. Now, China, Japan, true, you can't be upset with China or Japan or Mexico. Can't be upset with anyone. You know, when I announced for the presidency, it was very interesting what happened. I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went to. And then they lied. They made it up. I'm talking about illegal immigration. And I brought up a subject called illegal immigration. And I just saw back stage some of the families who were decimated. Their families were decimated, their sons, their daughters killed by illegal immigrants and it's a massive problem. We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. We have to do it. Have to do it. And when I hear some of the people that I'm running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. And a wall works. All you have to do is go to Israel and say how is your wall working? Walls work. And I want people to come into the country but I want them to be legal and go through the process. I want them to come in. I want to have a big beautiful door but they have to be legal. They have to be. And if they are not going to be, they can't come in. And I'll tell you what, the first thing we do, you know, people realize, you look at crime in Chicago, you look at crime in so many different places and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They are rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast, And I think a lot of these countries send them in here because they don't want them. What do they want them in prison for 40 years? Look, look, whether it's any country, their leaders are smarter than our leaders. They are more cunning. They are tougher. They are better. And we take them, Kate in San Francisco, this magnificent young woman shot in the back by a guy sent over here probably pushed over, who knows, but he was an illegal immigrant came over, went to San Francisco. We have to end this sanction wary cities crap fast, fast. So he admits he's guilty. Now he's got a lawyer. Oh, he didn't really know. He wasn't aiming there. It was a ricochet, blah, blah, blah. It's disgusting what's happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are a dumping ground. And let me tell you something, the whole subject of anchor babies, did you hear that character from one of the networks? Anchor babies, just really not a nice term. I said what would you do, what would you say? And it gives me like a 12 word definition. I said no, we'll have to use anchor baby. But I don't mean to be disrespectful, but when a man has a problem and he's got his wife or his girlfriend and they move her over to the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border, our side, now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives, hopefully a long, it's wrong. It's wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn't call that. That's not what the law says and people are finding out now that I'm right. We didn't say that somebody can be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have a baby and now it's ours and we have to take care of the baby forever. It doesn't say that. It does not say it. So we have to straighten out, we have to straighten out our act. We're going to have a great country. We're going to have a great border. We're going to have a border that's a real border. You people are suffering. I'm in New York but from New York, too. They are all over the place. We want people to be in our country legally. Legally. And we want great people, too. We want people of achievement. If you go to Harvard or Stanford or the Wharton school of finance or any of these schools or Yale and you're the top in your close, you graduate and want to stay in the United States and have your career here, you can't. They throw you out. They put you back in China, they send you back to Mexico. They said those are the people, we need those people. We need them in Silicon Valley. We need in Manhattan. We need them in Dallas. We need them. Why are we throwing them out? They want to be in this country and we throw them out. So we have so many things we can do. So many things we can do. Now I'll give you the little thing that happened the other day. Made a speech on behalf of the tea party. And by the way, the tea party people are fantastic people. They are fantastic people. They love the country so much and you talk about people that get decimated, they just get decimated by the media. These are fantastic people. They love this country. These are the people that we want. But I look at what's going on and I look at what's happening and I made a speech in Washington the other day for the tea party and your senator, too, Senator Cruz who happens to be a good guy. Good guy. Now if he comes out and attacks me on Wednesday night, I will take it back immediately. OK? But he is a good guy. So I'm standing there and the capital building has a massive scaffolding around it, right? Have you seen it? Massive. I said man that's a big deal. As a real estate guy, the thing I do best is build. Hey, wouldn't it be good to have the president that knows how to build? Like I'm so good at it. Infrastructures, roads, airports, highways, I could do it for a fraction. You know, I'm building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue under budget ahead schedule, can you believe that? And I got it from the Obama administration and everyone else wanted it, which I still haven't figured out but it's going to be a great hotel. But they are doing the capital building and it has got massive, massive scaffolding. And we are having in 2016, you know, we're going to have a thing called like an election and they say that this massive scaffolding. I heard this the other day from a construction firm that this massive scaffolding, they want to have it for the inauguration, wouldn't that be nice for me? But they want to have all the scaffolding down but they can't do the work because they don't have enough time. They have so much time. What are they doing, caulking, pointing, fixing, structure, what the hell are they doing? It is not a big deal. So they are going to take all of the scaffolding down, paying millions to do that, millions and then after the inauguration, they are going to put it back up again and pay millions of dollars. Do you believe that? Right? Now I say do it simpler, get them to work faster. Do you agree? I like the idea. No, no. I like the idea of the scaffolding being down when they are swearing me in, I do. I don't want to see all the scaffolding all over the place. I want to see that beautiful, I want to see it. I love it. Such a beautiful building. But you know what? I told them, I said why don't you just move faster? Work faster. Get it done. So you take it down and you don't have to put it up. They said we never thought of that. Believe it? But they are going to take it down. They are going to take it down. So they are going to take it down and put it back up. Can you believe this? So let me tell you. I'm going to save my first money for the United States. If I win, I will let the scaffolding stay up, OK? All right? I'll let it stay up. We'll save millions of dollars. So in the pictures, they will have some scaffolding. They can probably no a days do something with that. So in the pictures we'll have scaffolding. So not if I win, stand up, what did you say? Not if you win, when you win. So a story I tell is a friend of mine who is a big manufacturer, great guy. Can't do business with China. Can't get his stuff in there. He calls me, he's depressed. He says to me, Donald, I can't deal with China and he's a good guy, does great stuff, better than they do. I can't sell it. They don't take it. Finally take it and charge a massive tax. A massive tax. Another friend of mine recently, he bought an airplane, a rich guy. Bought like for these people here. They probably all have, but a really good plane. Our country is being drained. Our jobs are being stolen by all these countries, not just them all of them. What would president Trump do? President trump? Trump, trump, trump. What would president Trump do? So I'd call the head of Ford or whatever company. But I'd call the head of Ford. I'd say congratulations. I understand you're building a massive plant in Mexico and you're taking a lot of jobs away from us in Michigan and other places. I don't like that. I don't like it. I just don't like it. And he will say, well, Mr. President, it's wonderful, wonderful for the economy. It's great. It's wonderful. Whose economy? Not for our economy. We lose on everything. We lose on jobs. We lose on money. We lose on everything. So what I'd say is the following, I don't want you to do that. And if you do it, you're not going to have any cars coming across the border unless you pay 35 percent tax. That's it. No, that's it. And they are going to say, they are going to say to me, Mr. President, please, please, please. Now, I guarantee you, let's say I make this call at 9:00 in the morning. By 5:00 in the afternoon I think the deal is done, they move back to the United States. It may take a half a day longer. May be 12:00 the following day, but I guarantee you, so they will, what will happen is I'll be called by lobbyists but not giving me money. I won't take it. So I turned down $5 million last week, $5 million. So I said I can't take it. You know, I go like this. I just close my eyes. You know, it's really sort of not natural to me to turn down money. Does that make, but I turn it down because once I know the game. Once they give you, you sort of owe them, right? You know. How can you tell a guy, you know, you gave me $5 million and helped me get elected and I'm going to hurt you with client. So, what happens, I would say, is that I will get a call from the head of Ford, and he'll say Mr. Trump, you're doing the wrong thing. I'd say, no, no, that's fine. Just do it. Just do what I say. Do what I say. And I guarantee you after I tell all the lobbyists, special interest and people that donate to everybody else but me because I won't take their money, after I tell them all no within a short period of time they will call up and they'll say, Mr. President we decided to move our plant back to the United States, sir. This is going to happen. That's what is going to happen. So, just a couple of more points and you know, it's depressing, isn't it depressing? You know, we're together, we love each other, but it's like depressing if you think about it. Because it doesn't end. I could stand up here all night long, I could tell you stories, they are all depressing. But the good news is, they can all be remedied. Every one of them. They can be remedied. So, Iran deal, Iran deal. They did not read that great book, where is that book? The Art of the Deal. They did not read it. Secretary of State Kerry, he actually may go down as worst than , because he made this deal. He may be the worst. He may top her because this deal is the all time worst. We're giving them 1, think of this, we're actually giving them $150 billion. Now think of it. Think of it. We don't have the right to inspect. We have to wait 24 days but before the clock starts ticking, we have to go through this whole process. I mean they could build their nuclear whatever, distribute and then have plenty of time leftover to clean the place up. So, you have a 24 day period, not anytime, anywhere, which is what it should be. Think of another thing. They have one instance where in a very major area, they self inspect. Now, can you believe this? They do their own inspections. They do their own inspections. And another thing, look, having a good deal, we should have doubled the sanctions, let , wait for another month or two. They would have come and we would have a deal like you've ever seen. We have our chief negotiators, Secretary Kerry at 73 years old goes into a bicycle race. Think of it. He's wearing the whole gear of helmet, he's like , he thinks he's in a bicycle race. He's actually in a race. It wasn't just casual, I could understand that. This is a guy that's in a bicycle race. 73 years old, all the gear, falls, breaks his leg in the middle of our thing. Takes two weeks off, goes back with crutches. The people from Iran say, what a shmuck. Can you believe this? But this is who we negotiate with. Now, think of this, it's embarrassing. Isn't it like embarrassing? How do you , I swear to you if I'm elected as president, I will never go into a bicycle race, I swear. So, but you know, one of the things. But I know the toughest guys in the world. Toughest smartest , I know people that are great. I know people that are overrated, won't use them. I know people that you never heard of better than all of them. I know the toughest guys and the smartest guys in the world. Carl Icahn called me. Carl Icahn is a great guy, very successful. If I put Carl Icahn in charge of trade with China, believe me, believe me, we do great. And, you know, believe me, instead of the people that we have that are political hacks, you know who is negotiating for us? Political hacks, political hacks. I asked for some numbers today before I came here. I said what's the United States trade deficit with China, Japan, and Mexico? Now, listen to these numbers. With China last year, we had a trade deficit of $343 billion. $343 billion. That's gone on for many years. A business that's no good. What do you do, you close it up, you start all over? You forget it. $343 billion. With Japan we're doing much better. It's only $67 billion. I call it that we're losing. Okay? Trade deficit. $67 billion. They send us so much, we send them practically nothing. Now, here is the beauty, Mexico. So Mexico, again, I love the people of Mexico. I respect the leaders. But they are too sharp. They are too good. So everyone said they won't build a wall because I said I'm going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it, right? Right? And all of these weak politicians, they are weak people. They are weak, weak people. They won't pay for it. I watch it on television. The idiots like Karl Rove. He said Mexico is going to pay for the wall. George Will, Mexico won't pay. Okay, think of this. First of all, there is going to be a wall. This isn't one of those deals where they jump over it, they go to Home Depot, buy a ladder, jump over the wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a real wall. You know, you know, the Great Wall of China is 13000 miles. It was built 2000 years ago. It was actually built over a long period of time, but it started 2000 , it's a long time. So 13000 miles. What we're talking about is 2000 miles, but less, maybe 1000 because you'll have a lot of territory where you don't need it. You have natural barricades, you have some walls that were built that are OK. Although, I'd like to be nice in uniform. You know, if I ever put my name on it, I want a gorgeous wall. You know. The Trump wall, that would be a beautiful wall. That's why I have to make it beautiful because some day when I'm gone, they are going to name that wall after Trump, I think. But I listened to these guys, and they say, how stupid , I listened to them today. Some politicians said Trump will never be able to afford the wall. We can't afford it. It's too expensive. It's peanuts. It's peanuts. It's nothing. And Mexico is going to pay. Now, here is the Mexico number, right? Let's say the wall cost $4 billion. You know, they say $10 billion. That means $4 billion if you know what you're doing and the $4 billion will be much bigger, much better, much stronger than the $10 billion. Believe me. Oh, do I know how to build? Greatest. One of the greats. So, let's say it costs $4 or $5 billion. Our trade deficit with Mexico is $53 billion. So four or five billion is peanuts. It's peanuts. Mexico is going to pay and they will be happy. They will be happy. Now, look, if you have some dumb politician negotiating, I agree they won't pay, but when you have Trump negotiating for you on your behalf, they will pay. 100 percent. 100 percent. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, Hey, boss, uh, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge. No, they never said that, they're talking about the weather? Right? So he knew about it, he knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's got a very friendly group of people over there.. Look, it's called life, you gotta be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be, but I doubt it. He knew about it. They mentioned it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like every day or every other day. They didn't say, 'Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor of a certain area is against you' Oh, OK, they didn't mention it. Nobody believes it. No. 2: Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades, it's a disaster, their property over there. The taxes are through, I'll use an expression: coming out of my ears, OK? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, Let me ask you, is he going to vote for Obama?' I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know, I thought he possibly did. Romney? I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed is he called Christie and they had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I woulda never done it. And he knows it is wrong. He is going to say, no, no, no, we don't want that, Ford. We don't want you to go. We are going to charge you of tax because, you know, the way you do it, you charge a tax. And then he is going to be hit by his lobbyists. They give him millions. He has $135, $140 million. I don't want anything. I don't want money. I'm just taking little small contributions for people. The woman said $7. And I was so, with a beautiful letter. It's amazing. I like that because that's like an investment. That adds up to the fuel for the plane for a trip to Iowa, OK? It all does, but who cares? I don't want that because I don't want to be controlled. Last week, you heard me say this. I turned down $5 million by a big lobbyist. Not a bad person. You know, a tough guy. Not a bad person. But when he gives me $5, he's not doing that because he thinks I have beautiful hair. It's not that bad. And it is my hair. Is it my hair? It is. It is actually. People don't know that. I proved that, you know, in Alabama. It was really hot. It was rainy. I took off my hat and everybody said it is really his hair. It's weird. I don't have to do that tonight. Sort of nice. But you know, so we would go over and the lobbyists would say, no, no, we gave you millions of dollars, Mr. President. And you owe it to Ford. Let. You have the lobbyists. You have. And after about ten minutes he is going to say I can't really do that. They really helped me in my campaign. With me, they're going to call me because I know all these guys. But they never did anything because I don't want money. I turned the money down. I turned down so much money. I feel like such a stupid person. No, it's true. First time in my life I feel stupid. Guys are giving me, offering me millions. Don, I would like to give you million. Wait, I'm telling you, $5 million. I could have it right now and I turn them down. I go back and say, do you think I'm doing the right thing? How about , I will just take a vote. How about if I take all these money and promise, I swear to you, that I won't do anything for these people. What about that? No? That's what I thought. I feel so stupid. But you know what? That's the way it has to be. Because I think one of the things they like about me is they don't, nobody is going to buy me. Nobody is going to buy me. All right. So after about ten minutes, Bush goes out and he says, all right, you can build your plant. Build it. I'm sorry. Please, I dare me. I mean, it was so terrible that I even thought about doing that, you know, because you contributed money. OK. Me, different. I'll call him up and say I have to go. I don't want you in Mexico. I love Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I have thousands have Mexican people that have worked for me over the years and even to this day. I mean, I love the Hispanics. The spirit. I love them. They are incredible people. But we have leaders that can't compete with their leaders. Their leaders are too smart. So I would say to the head of Ford, sorry. You will pay tax. Every car and every truck and every part that comes across that southern border, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax. OK? That's what's going to happen. And this is too easy. I don't need any of the killers. I'm going to use them anyway. But this is too easy. This is like forget it. This is taking candy from that beautiful little baby, OK. So easy. So what happens is they're going to say, no, no, no, and they're going to have people call me. But these are people that I didn't take any money, I didn't take anything. I don't want their money. So they are going to have people call me. And I'm going to say get out of here. And if I know them, they'll be friends of mine, maybe. I'll say I'm not interested. And I would say, let's say this whole process starts at 12:00 noon. I would say by 4:00 in the afternoon, the head of Ford will call me and say Mr. President, we've decided to build in the United States. That will happen. OK? That will happen. If they're really tough, they'll wait until the next day. But I guarantee you by 5:00 the next day, they're back. And that's great. That's what we need. We need jobs. We can't keep giving out our jobs. You know, college debt. I go all over and I see the vets are mistreated in this country so badly. Believe me. You know, they did a poll. I'm like the most popular person with the vets. You know, I built the Vietnam memorial in downtown Manhattan, OK. And the vets like me a lot. And they did a poll and people were shocked. Why would you be shocked? Because I'm going to take care of the vets. The other one, college. College debt. It is out of control. And I go around and I see students. And by the way, you see what's happening with the college? I mean, you talk about like what they're doing. The prices of these colleges. The way they're rapidly raising. And students are borrowing money from different people but also from the government. It is the thing that the government makes money on, college students. No, it's true. They're making a lot of money on college debt. And the big thing we need is jobs. And students come up to me and they say, Mr. Trump, I'm borrowed and I can't even, I don't know how I'll ever pay it off. This is somebody that is a junior or a senior in college. And it is almost like they have no hope. To me, it is one of the saddest things I've seen in making the rounds. College students, college debt. And they say, and then I apply for jobs. One was telling me from a very good college. Actually a college in Iowa where I was, a great college. And they were saying, you know, I worked hard. I became a great student. I just became one of the top students in my college. And I can't get a job, he said. And a lot of them can't get jobs. So now they have the debt and they can't get jobs because China has our jobs and Japan has our jobs and so many other places have our jobs. We don't have jobs. So they get out and there is no place to go and they don't know what to do. We're going to solve the problem because we're going to bring back the jobs from China and we are going to bring back the jobs from Japan. And we're going to be fair. But if you look at the deficit, the trade deficit that we have with China, it is astronomical. People have said how are going to balance the budget? How about like making some good deals with China and Japan? Look at the trade deficits. I was in Los Angeles two weeks ago. I saw ships that were so big. I've never seen anything like it with cars from Japan. They're pouring off. We sell them, actually, you sell them some beef, right? This is one of the beneficiaries, beef. But honestly, if you ever look at the difference, the numbers here, it is so crazy. We send wheat. They send cars. That's all going to change. And we're going to have great relationships with these people. And you know, the amazing thing, every country in the world, thinks the United States is represent by stupid people, and they're right, of course. No, they're wrong. Very stupid people. And every country in the world, I mean, every country in the world, everybody makes money. And the funny things is we don't get along with anybody. Think of it. Here we have deals that are all bad and everybody hates us. I just came in. And I'm watching on television. That we're really in a very bad place with Russia. Now, we're working on the Ukraine and I think that is fine, but why isn't Europe sort of like leading that whole charge? Why do we always leading? We're working on the Ukraine. I think that's terrible and all that stuff. We've got a lot of problems. We're sending an f,22, brand new, gorgeous. And we have fighters, our best military people are going over there. And we're worried about the Ukraine. I think Ukraine is great. I think we should worry about the Ukraine. But you know, Germany is over there. Germany is far richer than we are. Germany has made a fortune. We protect Germany for no money, OK. We protect South Korea for no money. So Germany is over there, right? And they're not worried about it. But Obama is talking about the Ukraine. Germany said let these dopey people take care of us. And all the European countries. So we are sending our fighters. Now in North Korea, you have a situation where, you know, he's raring his head again. I just were had 4000 sets for. And 4000, that's a lot of sets. They're all made in South Korea. They don't make them in Iowa. I wish. Does anyone make television sets? They don't make them in Iowa. They don't make them anywhere in this country. So I ordered 4000. Samsung, it is LG, it is all of them. Right? They're all from South Korea. Sony is from Japan. Their sets aren't as good anymore, but that's OK. But they're good sets. They are great. I paid a fortune. Enough saying, they make a fortune. Look at the deficit that we have that South Korea. I love South Korea. I love all these countries. But why is it that we protect them? So this guy raises his head. Nuclear this, I'm going to wipe them out. We immediately send, we have 28000 troops over there which is nothing compared to the million that they have in North Korea, a big army. OK. They don't pay us anything. What are we doing? And you know what? Somebody said that's not nice. You're asking them to pay. How can we police? We're watching the Ukraine, we are watching South Korea, we are watching Germany, we are watching Japan. We protect Japan. We have a treaty with Japan. If Japan gets attacked, we have to immediately go to their aid. OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. That's a fair deal. No, no, that's the kind of deals we make. They have nothing. Don't worry about it. But if they get attacks, we have to go to Japan. Did you ever fly, that's a long flight. So we need smart people. And we can straighten this country out. We can make this country so, we can make it better than ever. We can make it better than ever. Saudi Arabia, I love Saudi Arabia. The people are very nice to me. They buy my apartments, you wouldn't believe it. It's true. They'll pay me anything. They have nothing but money. They have nothing but money. I have a beautiful plane. All of a sudden it doesn't look so good when I look at some of their planes. I'm jealous. It's terrible. I'm jealous. No, but Saudi Arabia, they make a billion dollars a day. In all fairness, that was before the, you know, oil went down. But now, let's say it is a half a billion. That's pretty good. You make a half billion a day. We protect them. We get nothing. And every time, if you think in Yemen those folks are after Yemen, then you ought to leave the room right now because you are not very smart. Yemen, did you ever see the border? It never ends. It is a straight line. It never ends. And you know what is on the other side, Saudi Arabia? The oil. If you think they are stopping at Yemen, they're looking for the oil. Don't forget I'm the one, the most militaristic person. I would build a military so strong, so powerful, so incredible, nobody would ever use it. Nobody would ever, we would never have to use it. I would have the best everything. You know, we have a military where we give to the allies, our allies. We give it to the wrong allies, by the way. You know that. We give it to the wrong allies. We don't give to the Kurds. We give to people. One bullet shot in the air, 2300 humvees, the best in the world. So I heard they left. And one day they abandoned 2300. I said no, no, no, you mean 23. You mean three. You mean two. You can't leave 2300. They abandoned 2300 armor plated, the best in the world humvees, 2300. Because one shot was fired in the air. These are the people we're helping. These are the people we're helping. And now the enemy has the humvees armor plated. And we have the ones where the non armored plated and our wounded warriors who are the greatest people we have in this country. They are the greatest. The greatest. And our soldiers aren't protected. And the enemy is because they have these great vehicles that they took. And that's just the humvees. You can go on to everywhere. They have the best equipment. So we have to get smart. And we have to know what we're doing. And I would build, I'm telling you. I am so into it. But in 2000, and Ann Coulter knows this. In 2004, as much as I am into the military, which I love and respect. I'm a huge fan of General Patton. I'm a huge fan of General Douglas MacArthur. To this day, he has the highest marks, I'm a person I believe in like marks and students and education. I think it is great. General Douglas MacArthur to this day has the highest rates in the history of west point. That means something. Nice thing. And we have to do something and we have to do it fast. We have to get the generals that are great. There was a general, I won't use his name, but he's leaving. And they said to him the other day about ISIS on television, what do you think about ISIS? Can we beat them? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be very hard to beat ISIS. And I said to myself can you imagine George Patton saying, oh, it would be hard? He would have them knocked out in three days and say where do I go from here? Where? Where? General Douglas MacArthur getting out with his corn cob pipe right out of the airplane looking out over the land that he just took. Can you imagine him? First of all they wouldn't go on television. They're too busy fighting. They want to win. They are too busy winning. We don't have winners anymore. We don't have winners in this country. But we're going to turn it around. We are going to have winners. Now, speaking of winners, this is so important. We all know about trade. We've covered it. It is horrendous. I'm going to get the greatest negotiations. We're going to make great trades. We're going to make a lot of money. We are going to be great. Everyone is going to love us, OK? We have, they're going to love us. So you know, funny before, in Business Week magazine, again, they had a story a while ago. The ten things the Chinese most want. Now, who is tougher, the Chinese on me? I love them and I respect them. I just hate what they do to. But who is tougher than me? The ten things, one of the ten things was anything Trump. Apartments, anything. Anything Trump. I say how could that be possible? Because maybe they respect me or maybe they respect us. I don't know. But anything Trump. OK. So we're going to be respected. We are going to be really respected. We shouldn't to go to Iraq. We did. We made a mistake. But we went out. We should have kept the oil. And you would have ISIS believe. You wouldn't have. Now, people say that's such a harsh statement. She said take oil? Who the hell has the oil? The Iraqi government is totally corrupt. ISIS is, just formed out of Iraq. So we shouldn't have gone in. And then the way Obama got out was a total catastrophe. And then I say total catastrophe. And I said, Reuters, 2004, July. I said don't go in because if you do that in Iraq, and I'm one that likes to be, like I love the strength of military. You have to use it in the right location. If you do that, you're going to allow Iran to take over because you are going to decapitate. They would two powers that were equal. They fight. They would go ten feet, ten feet, ten feet, then they rest. This goes on for decades. They go ten, ten, right? Am I right? So we decapitate one of them. Now, Iran is as we speak, meeting with Iraq to take over the country. And you know who is getting the oil, most of the oil? The stuff that ISIS doesn't have? China. Do you know that China is getting so much oil? Do you know what we get? Nothing. Thousands of lives. Wounded warriors who I love all over. $2 trillion, we have nothing. In Afghanistan, which a lot of people don't know not, it is very rich in minerals. We're fighting in Afghanistan and they have very amazing mountains and ridges. We are fighting in Afghanistan over the years. And on the other side of the mountain, they have massive excavation equipment from China. They're taking out all the minerals as we fight. We need people that are smart. We have people that don't get it. Look at the deal we have with Iran. Look at this deal. It is going to, in my opinion, lead to an arm race the likes of which there has never been. Countries are going to line up for nukes. You are going to have perhaps nuclear proliferation. You are going to see things that you have never seen take place in a short period of time. This is the deal that just the other day, it was determines after months. Did you ever see a deal take so long? The deal has been going on forever. They had our prisoners. We never asked for our prisoners. How about that? Having a deal is good. But we should have doubled and tripled up the sanctions and negotiate from strengths. We could have done it so easily. Instead we have Kerry that goes on bicycle races. He's 73 years old. 73 years old! And I said it the last time I spoke. I swear I will never enter a bicycle race if I'm president. I swear. I swear! He's in a bicycle race. He falls. He breaks his leg. This is our chief negotiator. He is walking in. They're looking at him like what smock this is. I watched actually on Charlie Rose. I watched the chief negotiator being interviewed by Charlie. And after five minutes, I tweeted @realDonaldTrump. I tweeted. I said this guy is too smart for Kerry. I was right. So we didn't get the prisoners. And you know what the excuse was? We didn't ask for them. We didn't want to make the deal too complicated. Think of it. They're fighting us in Yemen. We didn't ask anything about Yemen. Like don't fight us. We have a 24 day wait period. So if we think they're doing nuclear, we have to wait 24 days. But see, that's not the worst part. The worst part is the clock start ticking. It could be months. We have to notify. There is whole process. I mean, they could build, shoot and build a couple more shoot. And by that time we still wouldn't be in there checking. Like I can just see them sweeping the floor and painting it battle shipment gray. You know, when I was with my father in Brooklyn, I used paint the Roger's battleship gray. I would always like. You know what I mean by battleship gray? Shiny battleship gray. I can see them doing it. So what we're doing is crazy. So you have that. And then beauty of all and you heard it two days ago. After years, we just found out that they're going to do in the most important section, they're going to do their own inspections. Did you hear this? Iran. They are going to do their own inspections. Did you hear about this? With some of these guys didn't hear? Where the hell have you been for the last three days? Look at these guys. They're smart guys. Three days ago I heard it. Nobody knew. They are going to self inspect. It is so unbelievable that you just can't even talk about it. And here is another part. We're going to give them $150 billion plus. And even if the deal isn't approved, they get that. In other words, they get that regardless. You know, when I do a deal, when I buy something, I pay them when I guy product, right? Whatever it is. I buy a building. I buy a business. I pay them. I put up a deposit and, right? But I pay them when the deal closes. We're paying them even if the deal doesn't happen. I've never heard of this before. I don't know who came one this idea. It must have been Kerry. No, it must have been. Because I don't think the Iranians. You know, the Iranians, Persians are great negotiators. They are natural great negotiators. I don't believe they would have thought of this because it is so crazy. No, it's true. They wouldn't have actually said, let's do this because it is so far out. Who would have ever think of it? They get $150 billion plus, plus, even if the deal is voted down and the deal doesn't happen which the deal will probably happen because we have a lot of weak people that are going to approve that deal just like they approved Obamacare. You know, you elected people who would knock out Obamacare. They got to Washington. Something happened. I promise it is not going to happen to me. Something happens in Washington. They get elected. They're really going to do a job. They are all. We're going to end Obamacare. We're going to fight. We are going to end this horrible thing with the $5 billion Web site that doesn't work to this day, by the way, $5 billion. I have about 40 websites that cost me $3 and they work. So we're going to end Obamacare. You probably elected some of them of they go to Washington. I don't know. There is something about Washington. They look at the beautiful buildings, these beautiful halls. And all of a sudden, they become impotent. Is that an appropriate word? I think so. They become just, it doesn't work. Put those two together. Something happens to them. And all of a sudden they're not fighters. I think they're so impressed. They show their wives. Look where I'm working. I'm working in Congress. Of course I have to vote for Obamacare. Isn't it wonderful? Look what I am doing. But they got elected to knock it out. What happened to these people? What happened? So something happens when people get elected and go to Washington. The beauty of Washington. I'm building as you know, the old post office. Can you imagine? President Obama is in charge of government services who are tremendous people, by the way. They really are. They are very talented people. That's because they chose me. If they didn't choose me, I probably wonderful say that. But they are talented. They are great people. Now, we're doing a great hotel, one of the greatest hotels. I think it will be one of the greatest hotels anywhere in the world. But think of it. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after pieces of property right smack on Pennsylvania between Congress and the White House. Best location. You know, for the real estate people, they notice that any time you get a post office, it's good. You know, the post office was always there first. I have the old post office in Washington, DC So it is being converted to Trump international. It is going to be great. And just think of that. I got it from the Obama administration. To this day, I say, are you sure we got that? I tell you. But we're doing a great job. And here's the thing. We are head of , think of this. Compare this to government. We're way ahead of schedule. And we're under budget. Did you ever hear that before? You don't hear that. So we have a great country. We have a country with tremendous potential. The potentials here are people. We have great people. We have problems all over the place, but they're problem that's can be solved. We have to incentivize people. We have to give people spirit. When President Obama was elected, one thing I thought would happen, I really thought he would be a unifier. You look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis the other night, you look at Chicago, you look at so many different places, and you look at what's happening with the African American youth. It has never been in worse shape. Never. You look at what's happening with so many other aspects of our country. And there's a racial divide, there is a divide, period. There's hatred all over the country. I've never seen it like this. We have to unify the country. We have to spiritize the country. We have to create jobs. We have to do a tremendous amount of work. But it can be done quickly. I will say this. If the right person is not elected, come next year, I don't know if it can be brought back again no matter how confident and capable the person is. It is going to be too far down the line. No, it is going to be too far down the line. So just in closing, and you know, normally I would do questions. But this has been such a good time and everyone has heard such a brilliant speech. And you know, I was with Elton John. Anybody like Elton John? And a lot of times, like he'll do this last song. And it is so great. It is so unbelievable. The place is standing and roaring and going incredible. And then they'll be like, they'll come back for like three more, right? And the three are not as good as the last one. And people go, let's get out of here. So you know, you like to leave on a high note. And I just like to say this is a great audience. But I have, thank you. I love you too. Thank you. But you know, I have a statement. I say it all the time. And I told the story once before. And it is that the American dream is dead. But I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than before. Right? Good. But I got home one night. And my wife said that was such a terrible thing you said. It was all over television. And the problem I have with television, look. They're all live. What do I do? Every night I'm on live television. I suppose to make speeches. How do you make the same speech? I'm trying to change it up. But every night, CNN, FOX, NBC, everybody. Look at them. They're all live. It's not fair. No, no. These other guys, they go around, they make a speech in front of 21 people. Nobody cares. They make the , they read the same speech. They have Teleprompters. I say we should outlaw Teleprompters for anybody, right? For anybody, for anybody running for president. You how easy that would be? Instead of this. I'm working my ass off. OK? Instead of this I can just stand up. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, it's wonderful to be in Iowa. You know, everybody is going to fall sleep and half an hour we leave. No mistakes. No problems. But I walk in but they are always live, these guys. I think we are going, let's start canceling them a little bit. And by the way, they're getting phenomenal ratings. That's why they're live. They're getting phenomenal ratings. And you know, the old days, when I was with the Apprentice, they paid me a lot of money. They don't pay me anything. You know, for the debate, we had 24 million people. Now, normally there would be like two million people, right? When you say two million if they are lucky. They had 24. I won't take credit for but believe me, 100 percent it's me, 100 percent. It's true. It's true. So the ratings came out. They were so big and so, it was the biggest rating in the history of cable television or something like that. And you know, I was a little obvious, but that is OK. So it happens. I'm saying to myself well, if it's not me, I should go to CNN. They're doing the next debate. And I should I say that Jeff Zucker, a great guy, Jeff, I'm going to do the debate but I want $10 million for charity. American cancer society, AIDS research. We'll pick ten great, a million. Otherwise I'm not going to the debate. And honestly, I think they would pay me. I do. I'm, 100 percent for charity. But it might not look right, I don't know, Ann. I'm going to have to think about it. I sort of like it. Does anybody like that idea? Then we go to Roger Ailes. He is a great guy at FOX and we say Roger, you know, they did so great at CNN. You did so great at FOX. Let's make it like 12, 15, 18, all for charity. But I'm thinking about it, I am thinking about it, believe me. So I go home, my wife says to me, you know, what are you doing? What are you doing? It was a horrible thing you said. I said, why? What did I say? You said the American dream is dead. I said, I didn't say that. I turned on the television. TiVo is wonderful. I turn it on and they have it cut. It is the American dream is dead. Cut. I said, what a terrible statement. But what I do say, and I say it all the time, the American dream is to a large extent, it is in trouble, but we're going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And, and we are going to win the nomination, and we are going to get the greatest people that have ever represented, we'll get the smartest, toughest, best people to represent us against the world. And we are going to make our country so great again, you're going to be so proud of it. And it is an honor to be with you tonight, and I really look forward to being with you for many, many years to come. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Donald Trump finishing a speech in Dubuque, Iowa. It lasted more than 50 minutes, walking off to Twisted Sister, We're not Going to Take It, the theme song there. Hello, everyone. I'm John Berman, sitting in for Anderson tonight. What a night it was in Dubuque, where in addition to this 50 plus minute speech, Donald Trump also gave a news conference, and man, were there fireworks there. Univision anchor Jorge Ramos got bounced, thrown out of the room, then invited back. There were more shots as well from Mr. Trump aimed at Jeb Bush. A lot to talk about tonight, so let's bring in our panel. Amanda Carpenter, former communications director for Senator Ted Cruz. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. Republican consultant and former top Trump campaign adviser, Roger Stone, and CNN political commentator Peter Beinart, who also teaches journalism and political science at the City University of New York and is a contributing editor for Atlantic Media. Amanda, let me start with you, let's start on the speech. We have a lot to go over tonight, including Jorge Ramos getting thrown out of the news conference. But let's start with the speech. 50 minutes, hit a lot of subjects. Another way to say it is it was rambling. He talked about Iran, he talked about immigration, he talked about the economy, he talked about China and he talked about The Apprentice. What struck you? Thank you very much. I see these beautiful teleprompters. Believe me, I'm not using them. You know I said if you run for president you should not be allowed to use teleprompters. Get these things out of here. I was watching Hillary making a speech and it was outside. And they were dead, dark, big. They weren't even like this. These are clears. I can almost see right through them, but, which really is disturbing. Is that disturbing to the audience, wouldn't you think? But hers, because it was outside, were black, and they were twice the size. I said what kind of a speech is that? That's not a speech. Most importantly, I brought my Bible. Okay? And, you know, it's First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica. And this was written by my mother with my name, with, it was a long time ago, with my name, with my address, with everything. In case I lost it, somebody would return it. You know, in the old days, if you lost something, they returned it; today a little bit less so. But I saw this and I said I have to bring it and just show it, because it brings back so many memories. It's really an honor to be here. And, you know, David is a fantastic guy. He's done an amazing job. And we had some big news today with Boehner. And, you know, I've been saying for a long time, and I was just telling, actually, David, who said, by the way, I'm not a politician and I'm not politically correct. And I think that's a great thing. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of the political, I love this guy over here. Thank you. I'm so tired of the time and the effort of all of this. We don't have time. We have a country that's in such danger and such trouble. To be politically correct, every word is measured. And I can do it. I went to great schools. I went to an Ivy League school. So easy to do it. But who wants to do it? We have to get to business. I mean, we have to just get back to business. But we're going to have a very interesting period of time. And maybe it starts today, because Speaker Boehner, you know, some people like him on a personal basis. Do people like him on a personal basis? Anybody? You know, we want to see, we want to see the job being done properly. We want to see, we want people that are going to get it done. And I don't understand. They get elected. They're full of vim and vigor. They're going to change things. They're going to get rid of Obamacare. They're going to do all of these things. They come down to these magnificent vaulted ceilings that you see all over Washington. And what happens? They become different people. They become different people. They come out and they don't do it. And I will say, you know, for the groups that want to take what they say is a harsh tone, I wrote The Art of the Deal. And I will tell you, The Art of the Deal, if they would have read it, some of, and I'm talking about the Republicans. We know where the Democrats are coming from. But we are so disappointed in the Republican establishment, because if they stuck together, in all fairness, you have a certain group of 10 percent, 12 percent of Republicans that are out there fighting, fighting. But when the other side, which is Obama and the Democrats, when they hear that they're not going to win and they have no support, there's no way, from The Art of the Deal, there's no way that they can possibly win, that the Republicans can win. So they're out there. They're left hanging so many different times. If they actually were unified, if they were brought together and unified, and you said four very important things that you're going to take very, very strong, harsh measures, you're going to win, because nobody's going to, in 50 years from now, in 100 years from now, in two years from now, and even next month, nobody's going to be talking about the speaker. Nobody's going to be talking about any of the, they're going to be saying let's say something very important. The government shut down. They're blaming the president, folks. They're blaming the president. And, you know, it's sort of interesting. When you hear the Democrats, they're very, very good, very, very good. They go, oh, we want the government to shut down. We want it to shut down. That would be so great if it shut down. It would be so wonderful if it shut down. And the Republicans say, oh, they want it to shut down. Oh, that would be bad. We're playing right into their hands. These people are babies. Do you remember when they said they want to impeach, do you remember, no, they're babies. They're babies. Do you remember when they said they wanted to impeach, a small group wanted to impeach Obama? Right? Remember? And then the Democrats said, no, no, we want him to be impeached. We want him to be impeached. Please impeach him. It would be so good for him. It will make him look so good. And he'll get all of his points out. It'll be wonderful. Do you really think they want him to be impeached? So the Republicans come back. I was just telling the folks backstage, the Republicans come back. Oh, we don't want to do that because he wants to be. Who wants to be impeached? Oh, it's so sad. I mean, you know, like, you have this clown, Marco Rubio. I've been so nice to him. I've been so nice. I've been so nice. And then, no, but he's in favor of immigration, and he has been. He has been. It was the gang of eight. And you remember the gang of eight. It was terrible. And then he went down in the polls. And you have to stay. You know what? If you believe in something, you have to be true to yourself. You have to be. You have to be. But it was the gang of eight and it was really, really, you talk about weak on immigration; nobody weaker. And all of a sudden he goes down in the polls and all of a sudden he starts changing his tone. But you never really change your tone. You remember that. And also, when you're elected senator, you have to go and vote. It's so important. You can't say I can't vote. And he's got the worst record. And he hit me. And I said why is he doing that? And sometimes the Republicans do it more than anybody because they want to sort of catch on. They want to get into the publicity cycle. And all you're doing is hurting yourselves. I mean, it's a bad thing. All you're doing is hurting yourselves. Now, we have so many people that can be and should be attacked. We have a president that is extremely bad for everything that the folks in this room stand for, I mean, extremely bad. You know, freedom of religion, so important. We just don't see it. You know, you take a look at a thing like the Iran deal. We talk freedom of religion, look at the Iran, how long is this whole thing going to last when we have incompetent people, grossly incompetent people negotiating these vital deals like that deal where 24 days and all, I don't have to go over all of the many problems with the deal. Even Israel, Israel is in such trouble with this deal. And you know in that deal probably it says, and nobody even understands what says, which is a problem, but probably if Israel ever attacked Iran, we're supposed to come to their defense. Do we know that? Nobody's able to tell us what is going on with respect to that. If Israel has to, because at some point something might happen. The deal is horrible. The deal is horrible, from any standpoint. And we have to do something. And I can say it's going to have to be renegotiated. You know, I've made a living of buying bad, I love bad deals, because you buy them cheap, do you understand that? You buy them cheap. I love horrible contracts. I love buying, I bought them from friends of mine. I buy a horrible, horrible contract. The poor guy is dying with it. He's getting killed. I buy it cheap. I then go and fight like hell and make it a great contract. Sometimes you chapter it, some, you do lots of different things, whatever you have to do. And you make it a great contract. That contract, that agreement has to be changed. We have no choice, because if it isn't you're going to have nuclear proliferation, it's already happening. You're going to have potentially the destruction of Israel. It has to be changed. One of the things in that contract that I cannot believe, we're giving them $150 billion. Right? No, we're giving them $150 billion of which they're going to use, and already are using, they're ordering missiles from Russia. They're doing things that probably and definitely we can't allow them to do. But they're doing it. We cannot allow the incompetence that we've had going on in this country. We just can't, we have to use our greatest negotiations. We have to use our smartest people. We use political hacks, they're all political hacks. They're negotiating deals that they should, they have no right doing it. Take a look at another thing, one thing, and, look, nuclear's so important, but you have four prisoners. One of them's over there because he's a Christian. He's over in jail because he's a Christian. Now, at the beginning of the negotiation, by the way, it used to be three at the beginning, now it's four. But you say very simply before you start, fellas, and by the way I have to say, to the women, it's all fellas over there. They haven't figured out that women are smarter than men. They haven't figured this out yet. A little detail. They'll figure. It'll take another 150 years, but they'll figure it. You say, fellas, you got to give us back our prisoners. You got to do it. You got to do it. No, you got to do it. You got to give us back our prisoners. Now, they went to Kerry who is, you know, broke his leg playing, this guy's in a bicycle race, can you believe it? He's in a bicycle race. He's got the hat. He's got the emblem. I said, what's he doing? He as actually in a race. It wasn't just like let's get a little exercise. Breaks his leg. This is our negotiator, all right? So he walks in, he walks in with crutches. And they say, what the hell is with this guy? Is he crazy? We have to very simply, as an example, that example. You walk in at the beginning, not the end, not the end. You say, fellas, before we start, you have four prisoners. You don't want them. We do. It would send a great signal to the American people. It'll make the deal much easier. You'll make another deal. It'll make it much easier. You got to give us back. If they say no, you take a walk because you know you're not going to get anything. You take a walk. You take a walk. And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, as sure as you're sitting there, that within a short period of time they call back, you have your prisoners, you have them. But here's the worst, it isn't even, and you need the right messenger. If I'm the messenger, you get those prisoners back. I tell you what, I tell you what, I'll make this statement. If I get elected president, before I ever get to office, I guarantee you they will be back, I guarantee 100 percent. A hundred, that's a hundred percent. But you need the right messenger. And in the case of the prisoners, they never even asked. Can you believe it? They said, both Obama and Kerry said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations. No, no, I mean, this was really a statement. We don't want to complicate. So it's time. I'm a business man. I made a tremendous amount of money, a tremendous amount. It's ridiculous. I mean, I don't even believe it myself. You want to know the truth? I don't even believe it. I'm self funding, I don't want to have the lobbyists and the special interests put money into my campaign. I'm turning down, by the way, I'm turning down millions of dollars. I've turned down millions and millions of dollars. I actually feel foolish because it's so anti me. It' so, like, it's not me. But I turn down millions and millions. And yet, you know, I was in Iowa two weeks ago. And I had a great audience. We had a, we've had just such great people and great crowds. And I said to the people, do you mind if I take millions of dollars? I promise you I won't do anything for the people giving me the money? Do you mind? And they all stood up and they said no, no, no. It was really important. I didn't know it was going to be that important. Anyway, I think self funding's great. I'm the only one that's self funding. Everyone else, believe me, whether it's Bush, who by the way, along with Rubio, but whether it's Bush or anybody in favor of common core. I mean, I think of it. Now, you talk from a Christian standpoint. You want local school representation. You want local. Common Core is a disaster. But you people that really are tough and smart. You look at another thing, trade. That's what I'm, oh, I'm going to do so good. I always say I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. That I tell you. That I tell you. You know, people say, and actually, CNN did a poll and I come out so high on that, on the economy. And by the way, like much, much higher, not even close. I come out the highest by far on that. And leadership, I come out high on leadership. And I come out high on really other categories. Then I say, if I'm so high in all these categories, why do we even have to have an election, right? Why? Why? But a woman stood up, because I didn't sue, you know, the one thing I was a little weak on, people were not sure I was a nice person. And I am. I am. I am. I am, I'm a giving person. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. I'm a Christian. I'm, you know, I have a lot of reasons. I love, I love people. But the woman stood up. She said, Mr. Trump, I'm a big fan of yours and I'm going to vote for you, but I don't know if you're nice enough to get elected. I said, I really think I'm a nice person, but let me tell you something: I really think this is going to be an election based on competence. We need now competence. And we have to have something. We, we need help. We owe China $1 trillion. Think of it. They suck our money out, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. How does that work? Not so good. No, we owe them. Supposed to be the other way around, right? Japan. We owe them the exact same amount, $1 trillion. They sell us cars, biggest boats you've ever seen coming into the harbors. You've never seen boats, I've never seen ships like this. They're loaded, loaded with cars. So they send millions of cars over here. We sell them beef, beef. They don't want it. Half the time they send it back. They want to send it back. The farmers over there don't want it. So we take it back. That's not good beef by the time you get it back. I said the other day, no, no, I say it's aged; now they call it Kobe beef and we sell it for more money, you know, it's one of the,. But, but you look at the imbalance, the US trade, I mean, look at, look at the US trade. China, almost $400 billion a year we lose. Japan, $75 billion a year. Mexico, they all say the fence. First of all, we are going to build a wall, and it's going to be a real wall, OK? If people like it or don't, we're going to build a wall. And it's going to have a big, beautiful door, and people are coming to come into the country, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come into the country legally. And when people graduate number one in their class from Harvard and Yale, we don't send them out. And they want to stay in the country. You know, there was a case the other day I read about where somebody, a great student at a great school, couldn't stay. From India, couldn't stay in the country, no matter what. And they forced him out. And he founded a company a few years ago in India, 5000 employees, one of the most successful companies, an unbelievable job. We could have had him here, and we force them out. Silicon Valley needs people. We all need people. But we force these incredible people that have been in our system for years, we force them out. They graduate, boom, get out. So we've got to be smart. We've got to be tough. We can't allow our veterans to be treated the way they're treated. They're treated horribly. They're treated horribly. And our military? If I win, we're going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful nobody will ever mess with us, folks. We are really in serious trouble. You have, you have Putin the other day, not so long ago, saying, you know, they better be careful, we have nuclear missiles. I've never heard, you know, coming from Russia. But you have North Korea, you have so many other places. I brought up recently, you know, during the debate, anybody watch the debate, by any chance? How did I do? How did I do? Right? I won every single poll, and yet these media people, oh, Donald Trump didn't, I won every poll. I won Drudge. I love Drudge. I love Drudge. But I won Drudge. I won Time magazine. I won every single poll, Slate, places I never even heard of. I won every poll. Then I turn on the television and even, I think the Fox poll had me at second, and they, they wouldn't say it. They wouldn't tell. They wouldn't say I was in second. Other polls, they said I did great. Then I'm listening to some of the pundits. I won't use their name, because actually some of them are getting better, you know, as I get higher and higher. We're doing great. In fact, with Evangelicals in Iowa, just came out, I'm number one at 29 percent, substantially ahead of anyone else. I'm happy about that. You know why? That's the reason. That's the reason. But, but we have to be careful, as Christians. The progressives are pushing, the progressives are pushing to an extent that, if we're not careful, we're going to have some big problems, and even bigger than we have right now. Look, we need people that can support us. We need people that are strong and smart and can back us. The word Christmas, I love Christmas. I love Christmas. You go to stores now, you don't see the word Christmas. It says Happy Holidays all over. I say, where's Christmas? I tell my wife: don't go to those stores. I want to see Christmas. No, I want to see Christmas. And you know, other people can have their holidays, no. But Christmas is Christmas. I want to see Merry Christmas. Remember the expression Merry Christmas? You don't see it anymore. You're going to see it if I get elected, I can tell you right now. I can tell you right now. So I just want to thank you for the, it's been an amazing group of people. You've been amazing. And to have such a fantastic room. But I just want to thank everybody. You know, I got into this and everyone said, there's no way he'll ever do it, he's got this wonderful company, he's got, I do. I have a wonderful life. But I see what's happening. I see what's happening with the country. I see so many things going wrong, so many things that are caused really by incompetence, that can be straightened out. We can straighten it out fairly quickly. I will tell you if we don't stop it now, however, it's going to be, at some point it's going to be too late. You're not going to be able to turn it. You're not going to be able to turn it. But I got in and they said, you know, he'll never do it. So I did it. They all said, oh, he did it. Then they'll say, he'll never file, like, form A, which is basically a single page where you're signing your life away. I signed it. I signed form A. They said, oh, I don't believe it. Then they said he'll never put in his financials because maybe he's not as big financially as everybody thinks. I put in my, almost a hundred pages, like the biggest ever filed by far, by far, and I had it ahead of, but you know, they said, oh, he'll ask for all the extensions. And you had some of the politicians asking for extensions and they were one page. I put it in ahead of schedule, and it turned out the company was much bigger than anybody thought, much stronger. It was, it's an amazing company, right? So they said, this guy might be running. Then I go with the polls, and the polls go up just like the Evangelicals in Iowa. The polls, I start, bing, bing, bing, bing. And every single two or three weeks, when the polls come out, they said, well, now he's reached his cap. I started at 6 percent. It went to 9 percent. It went to 12 percent. It was like a rocket ship, right? You've seen it. I mean, I'm not telling you anything. And, and it went to 20 percent and it went to 22 percent. Then it went, and then the other day, in a Fox poll, it went up 2 percent. And I'm killing everybody. And they say, other people are surging, Trump is staying still. But I'm up! I went up. I didn't stay still. I went up 2 points, right, a big two points. And I had another one where I'm 33 percent, 33 percent, and the next one I think was like 12 percent or 15 percent, and they don't want to report it. They don't put the poll out. I said, why aren't you putting the poll out? Well, we don't like that poll. This is a great poll. It's a great poll. And they wouldn't put it out. So, you know, I get angry at these things, because you know what I like? I like fairness. Somebody said, do you have thin skin? I don't. If I'm wrong about something, I don't mind, the media can do whatever they want. But I have thin skin when I'm right about something when I know they're doing a number on all of us, because when I ran, and the reason I ran is because I want to make this country great again. And we're going to do it. We're going to do it. And we're going to do it a lot faster and a lot better than anybody thinks is possible. And I just want to thank everybody. You're special people and I love you all. And this is the key. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I guarantee you that young woman who just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting, disgusting. So we're taking about the media, and by the way some of the media's terrific. But most of it, seventy percent, seventy five percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that scum! They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished a speech and they said, Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. Like, uh, I spoke for forty five, fifty minutes. I then answered question, questions. And then I went around to you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly there's a media group that calls the media. And the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there little Katy she's back there. What a lie it was, no, what a lie, Katy Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that, it was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this, where they actually criticized the media and they said it was a total lie. And I love you, I love you, I love you. And then other people pick it up, you know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter, remember that, third rate, third. It's possible. It's possible. Look, my whole campaign is about honesty. We have a problem. People said, Oh, that's not politically correct, what he said about surveillance. But we have to have some surveillance. You had to see the whole speech. It was so good. That was when Carson went down. That was the thing that totally took him down. In Iowa, big audience. No, that may have been the beginning of the end but my speech is when he really began to go down. I talked about his book and in his book he says he has pathological disease. I mean, he actually says it. There's no cure for it. I compared it to a child molester because there is no cure for child molesting, other than , well, you know. Nobody. Then I talked about taking the lock at his friend's face, taking a hammer to his mother's head. Then about the belt. You didn't see the whole speech. That's the problem with what I did and won't do again. You saw what I said and it was fine. You have to see the whole speech to understand. I started talking about it and explaining, and then I showed how it doesn't work that way. I moved over and took the belt, demonstrated what I meant. People there got it. What they do, the dishonest press does, is one second of me playing with my belt. People go, What the fuck is he doing? They don't know it was about the knife going into the belt. They haven't seen the whole speech and what I was saying about how a belt doesn't stop a knife. I was showing a knife, a knife going into a belt isn't stopped by the belt. So, if you watch the speech, it took down Carson. That was the beginning of the end for Carson. I figured I had to do it. You know the expression in golf: Johnny, he's just hanging around. The guy was just hanging around. I couldn't understand it. He was just hanging around. It's fine when you put them both in. You can't put in just the one. That's only fair. I'm a deal guy. I've been winning all of my life. Like this property. I bought it six, seven years ago. I bought it for a steal. Eight hundred acres on the Potomac River. I bought it for nothing. I could sell it for anything. I'm not selling, but I could sell it for anything. My whole life is about winning. I always win. I win at golf. I'm a club champion many times at different clubs. I win at golf. I can sink the three footer on the 18th hole when others can't. My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose. In Massachusetts, I'm at 48 percent. You know why? Tom Brady said Trump's the greatest. He says it to anyone who asks him. You know, it's hard for a guy like him to say that. When you're a football player, you don't want to be taking sides in campaigns and having the Hillary Clinton people now say you're not as good as Bart Starr. You understand. So Tom Brady is great. Hey, look. I went through a depression, a real estate depression that was massive in 1990. The last one I made a lot of money because I was a buyer , like I bought this at the bottom of the market. I can tell , I'm so good at real estate, I've made billions of dollars. Tell me the day you bought the property and I'll tell you if you made a good deal. I made such a mistake with Chuck Todd because I told such a truthful , he asked me would I ever get out? I thought, Huh? I'm leading in all of the polls. Would you ever get out? I said, Look, if for some reason that I wasn't leading in the polls, that I wasn't getting the acclaim or the biggest audiences , and I'm getting the biggest crowds by far, much bigger than Bernie Sanders ever had. Nobody reports that, but anyway. We had 12000 people in Sarasota at 12 o'clock on a Saturday. Last night, we had a group in Manassas, they were so packed in. They couldn't get them in. You saw. So, I said to Chuck, honestly, if I'm down and not getting crowds, if I was down in the polls. I'm a believer in the polls by the way. Rarely do you see a poll that's very far off. Let me just say That interview was a couple of months ago. If I see that I'm not going to win, I'd get out. I'm not a masochist. I go home and I see my wife. She's always a good critic. She says, That was a great answer. Other people say the same. He hated it. I said, What's wrong? The only one who hated it was Corey. He was going like, Oh shit. But I quickly understood why. He was right. The next day, the headlines: Trump may leave race. He's a good guy, really good guy. Say hello to him for me, will you? You know, his best golf story ever was about Mike Donald, who almost won the 1990 US Open. He was leading the US Open going into the final hole. He was an early starter. A rabbit. In other words, he was a good golfer who never made $10, who was on the tour for 10 years. Leading the US Open. Had a great final round but he was in the middle of the pack. Two hours to go and everyone said he was going to win the US Open. He wasn't supposed to win the US Open because he was a rabbit. Jack Nicklaus, all the others, they're the kind of guys who usually win. So he's in the clubhouse, leading the US Open, everyone's doing great, watching it on TV. And then Hale Irwin goes crazy on the course. You remember? Irwin goes to the 18th hole, he's one down to Mike Donald, who no one had ever heard of. And Hale Irwin sinks a 97 foot putt. That was the one where he ran around the green. Now Irwin has the privilege of playing Donald in a playoff the following day. A full 18 hole playoff. Hale Irwin, naturally, wins because the other guy never wins. The champion always wins. Bamberger did one of the greatest stories ever on that. The next day they show Mike Donald, two pictures. One has him on Sunday and Monday, Mike Donald playing to thousands of people up and down the fairway, 20 rows deep, as he walks up the 18th hole at the US Open. Pictures. The next day, he doesn't win, he's seen walking up a fairway, nobody there, no money, his wife carrying the bag. If he had won, it'd have been a life changing experience. But he didn't win. Those pictures, famous, I remember them. A thing like that is always a possibility. It's never happened because I've been having this for a long time. I write a book, it becomes the Number One selling business book of all time. The Art of the Deal. All of my books have done well. The current book does well I don't even have time to promote it. Have I spent 10 minutes promoting it? I didn't take three weeks off, going all over the place to promote it. You sell thousands of books a day if you do that. So the book, the show. The Apprentice had some great run, it was the Number One show. What a lot of people don't realize is that I gave up a lot to do this not just deals but a two hour primetime television show for another two years. Don't kid yourself. I've always been there. In school, I was always successful. In life, I was always successful. My father was a successful real estate developer and he was a very tough man but a good man. My father would always praise me. He always thought I was the smartest person. He said to one of the big magazines that everything he touches turns to gold. At a very young age. So I don't know. It's the thing that number one, it's my hair. Number two, what don't people really understand? Those are the two questions I always get. Number one, my hair is real. It's me. I've seen these old pictures, I combed it the same way. Okay. I have a friend, Bill Zanker, who's a very smart guy. He said, If you didn't go through those difficulties in the early 1990s, when the press was just tearing you apart, you wouldn't be nearly as big as you are now. Again, I never went bankrupt, but I went through a lot, owed billions and billions of dollars. The press loved it, they were killing me, not talking about other people. I said to him, That's wrong. He said, No. If you didn't fight through it and become bigger than ever, you'd never be as big as you are now. Interesting thought. That's his feeling. I'm not sure if I agree. But you understand what he's saying. It showed a human something. Tell your son I think I'm a very nice person who gets along very well with people. I'm very loyal, to a fault. My wife said, You're too nice too long and then when you go bad, then you're too bad. Then she said, You get too vicious and you never forgive. You put up with too much too long. You get screwed by somebody. You're too nice, and then you flip, it's too long, too nasty, too horrible. Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor. We don't want that stuff. We don't want World Trade Centers. We don't want that ever happen to us again. It's not going to happen to us again. So I want to thank everybody for being here. It's a great honor. They have thousands of people outside and sometimes they'll say Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in? But we can't get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We're together tonight. Thank you. So we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa, great, great state, and in Iowa, Trump 33 percent. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20 percent and Carson at 16 percent and going down and Rubio at 11 percent and Bush at 4 percent. But it's Trump at 33 percent. It just came out. It's Iowa, we love Iowa. By the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I've been on that one too. A really great one. The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36 percent and then I won't even mention the other numbers because they're so low. You know, when you have so many people running, we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you'll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don't know. When somebody's down at zero I would think that eventually they'll drop out. The only difference is there's nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you'll be seeing that. One of the things I think that's so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy, so important, Trump 55 percent. Everyone else nothing. On the budget, I'm really good at these things, economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump, this is with 15 people remaining, Trump 51 percent. Everyone else bing. Oh, here's one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we're talking about today. I guess you've heard a little bit about it. But I've taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me. You know, all of my life, I've heard that if you're a successful person, especially if you have very success, you've done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can't run for president. And yet, that's the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs. We're being run by people that don't know what they're doing. Very sad. On illegal immigration, Trump 48 percent. That's with 15 people. Everyone else, no good. On a thing called ISIS, oh, don't worry. We'll have plenty, we'll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it? Here we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people, a lot of military people here. Who's military here? All right, I love you. By the way, speaking of it, we're going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody's ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They're never going to mess with us. You know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don't know what we're doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we're going to make it so great, so strong that people, gosh, they're not messing. They're not messing. And we're going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We're going to take care of them. Because they, thank you, they are not being taken care of. We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it's not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. So with ISIS, Trump 46 percent. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running. On foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say Well, maybe it's not my thing. But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that's it. I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know why he was there. He refuses to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He refuses to use the term. I don't even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don't. And then we're looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It's just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse. She's got no strength. She's got no stamina. Remember that. You don't need a president with no strength or stamina when we're being ripped off on trade, we're being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good. When our soldiers aren't being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today. One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we're the least prepared now than anytime that he's ever seen it and he's been there a long time retiring. That's how we are. In the most dangerous world we've ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don't know, they don't, I'm telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed. Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed? , They'd be interviewed after total and complete victory. Gen. Douglas MacArthur. They're not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later. These guys, and I don't think we'll have to. You know, just so you understand, Bush, Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he'll be elected. He's at what 3 percent? Right? No, but he said some things and I was like, I said Who says that about an opponent? You don't say those things. You'll find out what he said. But he said very nice things. But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone, the tone, of Donald Trump is not nice. And I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they're Christian and for other reasons. They're being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone. Hillary said the same thing. Mr. Trump's tone is not nice. These people are living in a different planet. Different planet. And remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who's strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things. You know, I know a lot of tough people but they're not smart. That's no good. They're easy. We need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country. We owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It's a, think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word. We owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We're really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military. And yet, we do deals with China where there's a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question. Japan, they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That's like a loss. You look at Mexico. We're going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It's gonna happen. The people I'm dealing with, and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there's 15 of us. I had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they've all gone down. We've got to keep it that way, right? I mean, Lindsey Graham. He's at zero. He's at zero. Zero. Let me ask you a question. I don't get Lindsey Graham. I don't get him, He's literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he's on television all the time and he doesn't go up. He's at zero, folks. His ideas are so bad. I'm more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn't. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn't know where the hell, ha ha. And he always sits with John McCain. It's like they're the Bobbsey twins. They're always sitting together. No, it's true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He's always sitting with John McCain, who's fine. I'm not knocking it. But you got to know what to do. Now me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament, I have a great temperament. But you've got to attack. If you've got to do something, you've got to know what you're doing. I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you're going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me. And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, Fellas, you're going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that's what's happening. And Iran's going to take over Iraq as sure as you're sitting there. And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left. And we have a president, we shouldn't have been there but then we shouldn't have left the way we left. You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans, wouldn't it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do? I'll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we're all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right? But you know, if you think about it and you'll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They're just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren't and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don't agree with me; they agree with the other side. But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we're not vigilant, that was the same person. I've got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I'll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don't you get her out because honestly it's inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up. See, our country has this kind of security. That's the problem we have, Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It's one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens. But you would think that everybody we're all on the same basket that everybody every single person, So you would think that if we could get together, we'd all be in the same boat. Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate. In fact, I tweeted Is that all there is? about the president's speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don't care. I don't care. You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn't notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. And I watched the next door neighbor saying, Oh, well we didn't report them because we didn't want to racially profile or we didn't want to profile. Give me a break. Give me a break. We're like the stupid country in so many different ways. It's so, can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that's happening with us? They didn't want to report them because they thought it was profiling. Okay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn't to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can't put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn't want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you're okay, you're innocent. Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center, the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were, but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center. So, what's happened is we're out of control. We have no idea who's coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what's going on. And then I looked at poll numbers and I don't mean polls where I'm winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it's very, very sad. I'll go after some of the numbers. 25 percent of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy, very highly respected group of people who I know actually. This is people living in this country. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25 percent. 51 percent of the Muslims living in this country, by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they're great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something's going on, and we can't put up with it, folks. We can't put up with it. 51 percent, 51 percent highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. So I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media, these people back here. They're the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest. I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right until the end. I had one of the politicians, Kasich, who is just getting, he's a horrible debater, He made a statement that Oh, they left after 10 minutes. Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody's leaving. Nobody's leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn't want to do that because it's not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don't want to show this crowd tonight. They're not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don't do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show, look at all the people over here. It's a record in the history of this ship. But they don't show it. They don't show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting. Disgusting. , And by the way, some of the media's terrific but most of it 70 percent, 75 percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly, there's a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there. Little Katie. She's back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie, Katie Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. And then other people pick it up. You know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate. So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don't want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple. It's very simple. So here's what happened. It's been a little controversial. It's been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that. But I have more, I wish we could call, is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn't you love that? Now they're coming at us in full force. They're coming, not coming at me. They're coming at all of us. They're coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They're fed up with incompetence. They're fed up with stupid leaders. They're fed up with stupid people. They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who, think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I've seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted. You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won't even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he's going to get away with nothing. He's going to have nothing. So he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, I shouldn't have done this. This isn't working out the way I thought. Anyways, so we get him back and here's the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed, They get five of their greatest killers that they've been after, after, think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years. So they get these, right now have gone, they're out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I'd hate to tell you. So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they've wanted for many years. That's the way we do it. The Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It's called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days, 24 days, we think there's something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it's much longer than that because there's a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever. But the best is where they have the right to self inspect. Are you doing nuclear weapons over there? Oh, we'll inspect tomorrow. Oh no, we're not doing nuclear weapons. You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that's profiling. Trust me, they're great negotiators. And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He's a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible. I always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said You know what? I don't think he's going to be a good president. I backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don't blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, This time I'm going to do it myself. We're not going to lose. We're not going to lose. We're not losing. And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That's so important. So, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it's impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night. And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy, Shall I read you the statement? Donald J. Trump is calling for, now, you've got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it's common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25 percent, 51 percent. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans, these are people that are here by the way, people that are here, 25 percent not 1 percent. By the way, 1 percent would be unacceptable. 1 percent is unacceptable. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part, think of that, as part of the global jihad. They want to change your religion. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Not going to happen. As part of the global jihad. And 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51 percent. Sharia authorizes, now look, this is, I mean, it's terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non believers who won't convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look, especially women. Tough stuff. And we have a president that won't even mention the term and you're talking about numbers like this. Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it's obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension, Where the hatred comes from and why, we'll have to determine. We'll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can't live like this. It's going to get worse and worse. You're going to have more World Trade Centers. It's going to get worse and worse folks. We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it's going to get worse and worse. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. These are people only believe in jihad. They don't want our system. They don't want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life. So they have no respect for human life. So we have to do something. Now, we can be weak. We can be ineffective. We can be foolish. So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn't have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn't had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn't had that carnage. So important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can't let these weak leaders diminish it. If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom! People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They're sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die. Now, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn't have guns. The bad guys had the guns. And these young people, and I tell the press you've got to stop calling them masterminds, these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren't masterminds. Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris, the mastermind. I was watching all the networks. I won't mention who but some of them disgusted me. The mastermind is on the loose. And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids, they go over there. They're young. They're impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS. And we have our anchors, I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don't hear it too much. But they say the young mastermind. Oh, he's brilliant. Young man, he's brilliant. I don't even he's got a high IQ, In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there, mastermind, bing, bing, bing, it's like shooting everybody. You've got to be a mastermind. So the press has to be responsible. They're not being responsible because we're losing a lot of people because of the Internet. And we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way. Somebody will Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We've got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They're leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. Oh, come on back. Where were you? I was fighting for ISIS. Oh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself. When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It's over. How about that? And now that they've become radicalized, they're totally radicalized. And how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn't get women. I don't know what the hell his problem is. It's probably the first women he's ever had. I don't know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree. Folks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what's happening because something is happening in there. Man, there's anger. There's anger. And we have to know about it. We can't be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things. We can't be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn't want to tell anybody. We can't be that. We have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don't worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise. So when I started this whole quest, I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It's been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed. We went to Dallas, 20000 people in Dallas. 25000 people. Mobile, Alabama, 35000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go, Florida, we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room, thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn't say I exactly love doing after the first one. But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms, all the same. I love you too. I love you, Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. There's an unbelievable love in all of these places, Oklahoma, 20000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There's an unbelievable love. And there's an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don't want to be bad people. We don't want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody. But we can't let people use and abuse our rights. We can't let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can't let it happen. We just can't let it happen. And I have a friend who's a very, very successful man, and I went to one event, he came with me. We had 24000 people. And this guy's a real tough cookie. He's a great financial guy. One of the guys I'd definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you're going to be in good shape when that happens. We won't have these characters. You know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I'm the only one that's self funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I'm the only one. Only one. I'm self funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they're getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know. I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, Honestly, I can't take it. I don't want to do. I can't take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money, my whole life I've been taking money. Now I'm sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, So what are you going to do? I don't want your money. And he said, I got to go someplace else. They're like gamblers. They're like gamblers. But I said, You like me best. I like you best but I'm going to go someplace else. Because they want to be part, they want to, , Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don't forget, I was the fair haired boy. I was like the establishment. They'd all come to me, and I'd give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max, bing, bing, bing. I used to say Senators, don't come to my office. Anybody that's a US Senator that calls me, we'll send you a campaign contribution. But you know what? I'll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS, they're corrupt, they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won't say Cruz because he's been very nice to me. Nah, he's been nice. He's got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you. No, I've been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don't know. He's a friend of mine but he's not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You've got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what's going on. Does that make sense by the way? Until we find out. And he talked about, that's inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right? But that's the statement of an inexperienced man, About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced? So Chris, who's a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won't do this a lot. Look, here's the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it. Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they're closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn't get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, Hey boss, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight. No, they never said that. They're talking about the weather, right? He knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don't think so. But I don't know. It's called life. You've got to be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They'd just say, Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you. Oh, okay. They didn't mention? Nobody believes that. Number two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It's a disaster. I have property over there, the taxes are through, I'll use an expression, coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, Let me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama? I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know. I think he possibly did. And Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it. So when Chris talks about, when he talks about lack of experience, I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said Wow, that is unbelievable. I would have probably filed them even when I didn't run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed. Everybody said Number one, he won't run. And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, Let's go to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay? But then they said, Oh, well he announced. So these talking heads, most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they'd say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn't go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they're brilliant. One's brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don't like him. But what happens is they say Well, he'll never file form A. That's basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A. Then they said, Well, he'll never sign his financial statement because maybe he's not as rich as everybody thinks. Then they said, And if he does, he'll ask for many, many delays because you're entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they'll delay it until after the election. I said, No so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn't believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned. I built a great company and the reason, honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that, low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets, Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Avenue, land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over. In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location. And what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said Oh, I can't believe it. Then they said Well, maybe he won't do so well with the polls. And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run. And I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me You know if you run you will win. Don't you? She's very smart. I said, What do you mean? She said, If you don't run, you're never going to poll before. Nobody believes you're going to run. So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren't great before I announced. She said, No, the only way you're going to get a poll number is you've got to announce. Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you're running, it doesn't matter. Nobody believes you're running. So I said, All right. I'm getting these lousy early numbers and I'm saying, I don't know. I don't want to run and find out it doesn't work. I don't want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It's true. It's true. So I said, All right. Let's take it. So we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I'm telling you and you know what I'm talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, Let's go to my wife. Thank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I'll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she's very proud. The only bad news, I can't get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can't speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that's okay. It's an honor to be with you. You know, I've devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven't done what I've done. I've received many, many awards. I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, Don't do it. Don't do it. I walked up Fifth Avenue. I'm looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, No way am I not going to do it. And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had. So, I'm in a different position than the other candidates because I'm the one candidate I don't want any of your money; I want your support but I don't want your money. I'm self funding my campaign. It's been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far. I thought by this time I'd have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it. At first, I was embarassed by that. I said, You know, I think we're going to have spend money just to spend money but it's not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It's not even close. Every single poll, every single state. The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire, the PPP poll, Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right? Most of importantly, favorability, no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That's ultimately the most important. And you know, I've been a tremendous fan and I've been a tremendous contributor. I've given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job. And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind. In fact, I've been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It's loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you. My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they've been great. They have been great. So, Obama is the worst thing that's ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst. And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro Israel, very, I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they're having fundraisers for Obama. I said, What are you doing? And it's almost like they answer me and they say, We don't know. He comes to New York. We don't know. We don't know. I said he's a disaster. I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I'm a negotiator like you folks. We're negotiators. We don't build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million, can you imagine this? A small gas station,$43 million, and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don't sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station. How many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please? But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don't need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It's true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion. They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self inspect. We're going to let them self inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we're all good with contracts don't start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect. And we don't even get our prisoners back. And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don't want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three. Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago. And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I'm saying. It should have been you walk in, by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn't win anything. We didn't win anything. But that should have been with our prisoners, day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don't want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it's going to look good. And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They're going to say, No, we're not giving. And we're going to say, Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you're ready. And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they're calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It's so easy. Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I've ever seen. No, he's the worst negotiator I've ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he's one of the few. He's one of the, biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn't read it. And Obama definitely didn't read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh. But they said, this is hard to believe but this is what they said, a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don't I end up with a, they said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It's really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn't want to complicate, so now, we're going to end up making a new deal probably at some point. I'd tell you this, look I'll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They're going to be back, I guarantee you. They're going to be back. Now, our president doesn't want to use the term, we had another event, which probably was, the one yesterday, probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related, radical Islamic terrorism. And I'll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There's something going on with him that we don't know about. Now, as far as Hillary's concerned, she's going to go with what he wants. She shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn't be allowed to run. She's going to have to follow his line because she's on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his US Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it's very dishonest what's going on with our government. General David Petraeus was given a life changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially, look, I don't want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went, for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did. And Obama, I mean, she can't go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That's the end of it. That's the end of it. So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he's got control of her. I mean, it's just total control. But I'll tell you what, she shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act. And remember this, this is a six year, you have a six year statute of limitations. So she's fighting for her life. If she doesn't become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody? Because what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she's been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it's Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption. She was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole, the world blew up around her. It blew up. 500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn't respond. The truth is she doesn't have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we're talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there. But she responded, yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don't get that. But she responded to a friend, but she doesn't respond to an ambassador that's asking for help. Hundreds, hundreds of requests and she doesn't respond. Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd. The other day I was in Florida, we had 12000 people in Sarasota at 12 pm with the football games going on. 12000 people. The convention center held 5000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speeches. I said, You can't get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech? My people said, No, this is the biggest one. We set a record, a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It's true. Elton John. I'm no longer competing with politicians. I'm competing with the musical talent. One of the great musicians said You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar meaning who doesn't count on music. So it's true, we've had tremendous response. We've had incredible response. I think you know if you look at what's going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls, again I don't want your money therefore you're probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn't want money therefore we can't, even though he's better than all these guys, even though he's going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don't know if that's, but they said I'm the only celebrity. I don't know. I'm not a celebrity. See now I'm a politician. I'm so embarrassed by that term. You know, my how life I've been a business, I've been a developer. I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company. A lot of people said, Oh, he'll never file. This you'll get a kick out of. He'll never run because he'll never want to file various papers. And then he'll never file this and that and then you'd have to sign your life away. The first paper, we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That's the end of it. He did it. Then they said, Well, he'll never sign and he'll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he's not as rich as people think. So I filed my financials, almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, Oh my, it's much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers! If I didn't run, I'd probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It's true. Some of the greatest assets, Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many, Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things And the reason I bring that up is because that's the kind of thinking we need. And I don't bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that's the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don't know the first thing about the word negotiation. I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they're better than Obama and they're better than Kerry and they're better than the foolish people, the foolish people. It's so embarrassing when you see what happens. Sergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl, we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one. And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him. The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, No, he deserted. He was a traitor. And we still made the deal. So we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to renegotiate deals? Some of us will renegotiate deals. I would say about 99,is there anybody that doesn't renegotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to renegotiate, perhaps more than any room than I've ever spoken. Maybe more. It's okay. I've been called on that a couple of times too. But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell, they can have him even if we don't get the five guys back because that's not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They're right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in. So they get their five guys that they've wanted for nine years they've wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that's the way our people negotiate. They're stupid people. Okay? They're stupid people. It's very sad. It's very sad. So I'll just tell you that I'm going to win. I am. I'm going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I'll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here's a nice one, you're number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people, talented people, great people. But I believe I'm going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I've won, and my life has been about winning, and that's what I want to do for the country. And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest. It's like the other day, Ivanka, she's doing so great. Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, Honey, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka? It's amazing. See? Now I'm dealing in trillions. I've never heard of trillions before. You know, with this, we owe $19 trillion. We just signed a budget that's so bad and the Republicans, you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they're going to end Obamacare, which I'm going to do by the way, I'm ending, I'm terminating, it's going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they're going to do this and they're going to do budgets, like I heard the guy before We're going to work in the budget. It's all about that. What happens is they're going to do budgets like we're going to do this and that and I tell this story, then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors. They've never seen anything like it. We've arrived. This is incredible. And then they become mainstream. We'll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote. They don't want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they'd get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they've let us down. That won't happen with me. So, again, you're not going to support me even though you know I'm the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I'll be that. I know why you're not going to support me and you know you're not going to support me because I don't want your money. Isn't it crazy? No, it's true. You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I'd have a damn good chance and I think I'd get more money than anybody else. Do you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions. I would have made, poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It's sad. No, it's sad. I came up with that term, it became so defining. It's like having it on his forehead I am low energy. No, no, it's sad. He raised $125 million, which means he's controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money. That's why you don't want to give me money, okay? But that's okay. You want to control your own politician. That's fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don't worry about it. I understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who's better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It's true. $350000. I didn't receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don't give any, why would I give any more? You don't get a thank you letter. Politicians, remember this, politicians forget, politicians generally aren't competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that's what you're going to end up having. But I would love your support but I don't want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let's take some questions. Okay? Good. I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we'd do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What's happened all over. What's happened in Iowa. It's been really incredible. We've had some amazing results and they continue to come in. Got a little shake up in Iowa. I don't know what's going on. Somebody said Are you going straight to New Hampshire? Now, I love New Hampshire. We've got great numbers. 38 to 12. That's good. But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds. Everybody said and it's very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they'd have like 50 people and they wouldn't need this room. Believe me. But everybody said without question in every poll, this isn't just here, that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don't go anywhere. They're staying. It's true. I see it. I see it. And we've seen it. You know, a couple of times I say Well, that could be the end. Then they do something and I'm 10 points up. It's the craziest thing, right? But we'll take it. But they say the people are with, we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it. The other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don't you think? Leadership. I mean, when leadership is number one, they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot. So you know it's great. I thought I'd talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right? We have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it's always tough when you're on live television all the time. Look, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics? The bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you're on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you're talking about immigration and you're talking about the wall because we're going to have a wall and we're going to stop illegal immigration. But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about. But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it's really about results. Isn't it? It's really about results. And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways. I talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we're losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples. But it's still going to be a certain number of subjects. I talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments. You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. At least with me it's not going to happen. That I can tell you. So I said today you know we'll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we're going to have some fun. We're going to do that. A few things, I want to bring up a few new subjects. So, immigration, we're going to be doing a very strong number. It's killing us. It's killing us. And it's bad for the economy. It's bad for, all of this illegal immigration. And I have to tell you legal, you come in and we're going to have a good time and you're going to be there and you're going to do great, and visas, maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we'll do something, we're not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We're going to make our economy much, much stronger. But we're also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We're going to get jobs. We're going to get jobs. But the illegal immigration, you know, I did this and I made my determination, I took a deep breath. Because I'll tell you what, it takes courage to say I'm going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it. I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again. All of these incredible places that I have. But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you're putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody's done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it. Now at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don't we agree? It's getting ridiculous. Because like tomorrow night we're having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long? Hillary's debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was, oh, it was, you couldn't watch it. You have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he's not going to win. Just so you understand, He's not going to win and neither is she Well, she's being totally protected because in theory she shouldn't even be allowed to run. She's being protected. It's a tough game and it's a nasty game but she's being totally protected. But she's going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O'Malley. So he'll be out quickly, I guess. I don't know what's he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero. And I wouldn't say it against our folks. But they've treated me, some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points. And you know what? I'm not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that's hit me so far has gone down. They've gone down. And they've gone down bigly. And a couple of the ones and zeroes, they're the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they're like desperate people. But they hit. One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don't understand. What does it mean? I assume it's a typo but maybe not. But when you look at the things that are happening with our country, the trade situation with not just China, I talk about China all the time because that's the main abuser, that's the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it,$400 billion a year. And they send stuff over here but we can't send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax. A friend of mine can't get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax. Somebody bought an airplane in China here. Can't get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can't get it over there because the tax is so massive that he's now selling in this country because China won't let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax. I won't even tell you what the tax is. It's so astronomical that I don't even believe them myself. So I'm not going to say it because those guys will say Well, he was wrong. All I can tell you is it's a massive tax. Like you don't buy planes here because if you do, you won't be able to get them back in. And here, we accept all of their products. So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China. We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan. We have a, you know, with all that's going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer, a relatively small ship, over there, I don't know if I'd want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they're being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen. But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they're smarter, sharper, more cunning. The leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They're taking so many of our companies. Even Nabisco, my Oreos, they're taking Nabisco. Right? I'm never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don't want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back. But I'm not happy. They're leaving Chicago and they're moving their big plant to Mexico. So when you see this happening, we have to stop it. And I'm not going to beat around the bush and Oh, let's talk and let's be nice and let's say, Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody. We can, I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm not perfect. Nobody's perfect Now, nobody's perfect. But I'll tell you when it comes to that stuff I'm really, there's nobody better. Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He's one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he's not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they're doing. He understand. You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on. Corporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2 trillion overseas right now. They can't get it in. And everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They've agreed for years. They can't make a deal because they have no leader. It's not like Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else. Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I'm friendly with all of them. I'm friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody. You know, everybody says Oh, you won't be a unifier. I'll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier? But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything's going to be great. Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn't have done it. But when you look at what's happening with corporations and the highest tax, we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country, but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can't get their money back. And the reason is bureaucracy. It's very hard. And also big reason the tax is too high. They don't want to bring $1 million back and pay $300000 or $350000 tax. They'd rather leave it over there. And if they bring it back, they'll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen. I happen to believe it's more than $2 trillion. But here's the thing and I use it because it's so incredible. Here's the thing. It's not controversial. It's not like you have the Republicans here and you have, everybody agrees. They've agreed you know that for 2, 3 years. They can't make a deal. And now what's happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States, two reasons, lower taxes but also to get their money. They've got billions of dollars overseas. They're leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax. And you're talking about one company I know of, I don't know how much they've written about it, but you're talking about 6000 jobs just one company. You're talking about potentially thousands of companies. And I say it, in the old days, they'd leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they'd move to Texas or they'd leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they'd move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That's what's happened. In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it's a different world out there. And there's no loyalty. They're paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they'd like to move back to these countries. They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don't mind. They don't have loyalty to the United States. So my plan, my tax plan, is something I'm very proud of. We're going to solve corporate inversion. I'll tell you what, we will have that money back, if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don't even know about it. It's not their wheelhouse. Okay? It's not their thing. It's not their thing. Their thing is getting reelected. That's what they're good at. They get reelected. And they make promises and they're all talk and they're no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It's always the same. So we have so many different things and what I've done with our tax plan, which something I'm very proud of, we've brought it down to a few groups. Because right now, you have to go out, people who aren't doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They'll pay $500, $1000 because it's so complicated. And we're going to make it nice and simple. And we're getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we're getting rid of it. They don't love me so much anymore. But I don't care. And we're getting rid of a lot of things. So we're going to have a nice simple tax return. Somebody said Oh, why isn't everybody paying? You know, 40%,a big percentage, will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly. They said, well, I won't use the candidates' name because I don't want to insult any candidate when they can't defend themselves. They said We want everybody to pay at least something. And I said, I agree. Here's the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you're talking about millions and millions of returns. You're talking about building the IRS even bigger and it's a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you're talking about is far less than the administrative costs. So I said, I agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it's too much. Most of these people aren't paying anyway. What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan. I was in Los Angeles. Ships, the biggest ships you've ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing. The balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes. See, what our people don't know and only somebody that wrote The Art of the Deal or does this stuff. It's natural. It's like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he's just better. And you have athletes, very few, but there are some people that have a certain ability. A lot of people don't even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China. You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1,think of this, trillion. $1 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It's a magic act. For them not for us. For us it's a horror show. It's going to end. It's going to end. And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators, I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I'll be honest with you. I don't care. Do you care if they're horrible people? Who cares? Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he's a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he's built a fortune. He doesn't want money. He doesn't want to say, Oh, give me $200000 a year in government money. He wants to do it. He's proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it's so easy for him. For instance, if I say Carl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we're losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair. I don't have to give him a big speech. I don't have to give him a big speech. I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it's going to be our benefit. But think of it, if we're losing that kind of money, that imbalance. It's an imbalance. Some people will say That's not really a loss. It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that's a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn't sleep. If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right? But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you're talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen. And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they'll have 75% and maybe they'll like them better. Maybe they'll be better. And they'll be manufactured here. Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television, other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan. But South Korea, LG, Samsung. I don't get bids from American. I'd love to. I'd love to. George Will said there's a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I'd like to have a good name too by the way. It's important. You know, when somebody's paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it's nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree? Well, it's a company in South Carolina but they don't make them there; they assemble them. They'll order parts that come in and they'll assemble them. But much different. But I'd love it if we made them. But you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don't talk about him. We made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst. These are the people that represent, these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, You shouldn't say stupid. It's not nice. But it's true. They're stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don't know is there something going on that we don't know about? Think of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We've given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don't have to develop, I was telling somebody they don't have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it. What the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they're going into Syria. They got so much money. They're a terrorist state. They're going into all of these different places. We're fighting them in Yemen and yet we're making a deal with them. So why don't you say Hey, Yemen out? Our prisoners, I want them back. I want them back. I don't want them over there. I want them back. And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I'm the right messenger. You know, I've gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It's terrible. Right? Because I can't be so nice and say We can all do a wonderful job. People can't do those kind of stuff. For instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we're going to build a wall. It's going to be a real wall. We're going to have people come through and they're going to come through legally. Or they're going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it. And we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don't want to say no. But we have at least 11 million, you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we've been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be $50 million But we have to get them out. We have to, look, it's harsh. Dwight Eisenhower, we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right? I go remember he got elected,I like Ike. How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we're going to find ourselves a Patton and we're going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We're going to find ourselves a Patton. But we're going to find a Patton and we're going to find a MacArthur. And I'm really good at that. We're going to find great people. And I've told this story where I watched these generals go on television, they shouldn't be on television. They shouldn't be talking. You know? They shouldn't be talking. They should be doing. And they asked a certain general, I'm not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here's general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what's he doing on television? And he's saying Well, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out. By the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said Take the oil? Always take the oil! They're being funded by the oil that I said take. I don't want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn't do it. We shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn't have been there. We totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it. But we were there. Then Obama announces because he's so predictable We are leaving on a certain date in a year. Right? I couldn't believe. I was sitting there thinking Did he really say that? He said We will have all troops out by a certain date. Right? Did he say that? I said No, no, tell me please. Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I'll be the best in the military because they say I, you know, I always say I'll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that. But you know what I'll be? I'll be the great at the military. I'll be so good. And I'll know when, and I'll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody's going to mess around. We're never going to have to use it. We're never going to have to use it. And I'm going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they're our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I'm going to take care of our vets. So go back. So the world is unpredictable. I made a business deal a year ago. And the guy, oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That's my own problem. I guess. But to me it's like a painting when you could do something like that. So I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don't call this guy. They ended up calling this guy What do you think about Trump? And he said but in a respectful way, he said He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don't know what the hell he was going to do. That's a positive. That's a positive. I mean, if you're a poker player and you're predictable, you're not going home with much money. Okay? But it was really, I said, That's not nice what he said. First, I said That's not nice. I'm unpredictable. Then I said, Wait a minute. He meant that as a compliment. And I called him. I said, What did you mean by that? He said I think that's the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles. So with Obama, when he announces that we're leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn't have been there but once you announced the bad guys, you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, Hey, what do we have to get killed for? I mean, these people don't mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said If we don't have to, let's not. So they moved back. And they said, Hey, they're leaving in, What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. We will have all troops out. I'm a great president. So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, Oh, you're leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let's go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he'll change his mind and stay. So let's let him think he has this great victory with the surge. Right? The surge worked! What happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, Let's wait. Now we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That's what happened. That was the surge. Everybody talk so much,Oh, the surge was so great. The surge was great because everybody knew, they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush. I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, Let's get them out. Everybody wanted to leave. Now, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won't even say. People say, Mr. Trump, what's your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where? I say You know, I don't want to talk, I have a real chance of winning. I don't want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don't really want to tell you. I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let's face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it's got flaws. But you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say, although some people, I see it here, some people say We love that. We love that. But when I give that answer, some people say Oh, Trump doesn't know. He doesn't know. He didn't give an answer as to exactly what he's going to do. Exactly what he's going to do. And I know exactly what I'm going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, You know, here's the problem. If I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win. They're going to say Trump wouldn't give us the answer. They don't know it's unpredictability. They don't know it's strategy. And I said for a period of time like a month, I said I don't want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I've been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we're doing well. Iowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job. First of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that. And I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don't know what I did. But I am a great Christian. I'm a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date, I won't tell you what date it was because possibly you'd think I'm younger than that. But she didn't want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her. So cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, You know, By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition? Do you think these guys, I'm not going to say Carson, I'm not going to say Rubio, who really is way down, I mean, I am second. It's not like it's terrible. But I don't like being second. Second is terrible to me. But do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they'd come into your office. I've made many deals with China. I've had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There's no Hello. How are you? It's a wonderful day. They come in,We want deal. There's no games. I do this for a living. I'm really good at it, folks. Really good. And you know, when you talk about energy, I'll tell you one thing, everybody agrees, oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I'm going to make the best deal for you folks. I'll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You're going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We're going to have numbers are going to be so good. I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning. We don't win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever? We lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody. We lose with trade. When are we going to come back and say, We beat China on a deal? When are we going to come back, We beat Japan? Do you know that everybody said Oh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1 trillion and they send all those cars. They have no power. If we ever say, Listen, if you're not going to treat us fairly, we don't want your cars anymore, they'd go out of business, folks, they're gone. Same thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, Oh wow, we can get away with this and it's going to make it impossible. Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they're not getting stuff out because everybody, Japan and China in particular, is devaluing their currency. That's their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we're making doesn't even cover it. That's their number one weapon and the trade that we're making doesn't cover it. So I only say this and you know what? People might say It's terrible. He's a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I'm going to vote for him anyways. Okay, that's fine. I'm actually a nice person. I always say this, nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I'm running against. They're wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares? I was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn't even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It's not their thing. And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we're being eaten alive. That's why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren't working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It's not 5%. That was done for politicians so they'd look good. It's not 5%. How can you have 5% when you have 100 million people? You look for a job. If you're a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right therebut if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can't get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It's the most ridiculous thing. We have a tremendous, tens of millions of people in that position. They can't find jobs. They're good people. They want to work. They can't. But it's not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good. So let me just before we talk some questions, I'm going to talk about something I've never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It's called Super PACs. It's one of the great scams of all time. It's one of the great scams. So we sent out, I think I had, and it's not me. People set them up. And I don't know. Maybe they're setting up for my benefit. Let's take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don't talk to him. I don't do anything. I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don't even know. They're all over the place. Trump, Trump, one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. They have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don't know. And we aren't supposed to call them or anything. Okay. So, we wrote a letter, a legal letter, to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don't want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that's having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he's going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not. So we sent them a, it's a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It's a disgrace that we have. A disgrace. And I'll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he's paying a lot of money and that's not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they're paying, now think of it, who pays, the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I'm telling you it may be off but you all know it's a lot. I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune. I know in Romney's campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It's better than being a real estate broker. For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It's a scam. It's a scam. Now, in Ben's case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses. In the case of Jeb Bush, you're not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They're not supposed to be coordination. They're not supposed to be talking. They're right next to each other. And that's nothing compared to what some are doing. It's a scam and it should be stopped. And it's unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money. And what happened and I haven't talked about this before but I'm seeing what's going on. It's horrible what's going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall. And this is a wall too. Won't be as good as the one I'm going to build but it's a wall. But it was a wall and they didn't deal. I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I'm sure they never talk. I'm sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I'd say 100%. I'd say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever. They're not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that's the way it works. And in some cases, I hear in Ben's case, I hear in other cases, they're literally running. I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they're all doing. That's why he's out of the race because he couldn't figure it out. The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They're all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don't want to get advertisements. We don't want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don't even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They'll probably if they actually raised money for me, they'll say What a horrible thing he just said. I think we're going to support somebody else. They could do that. But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing. I feel it's very unfair. I feel it's a very unfair situation. Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything. But what are they doing with this whole thing? And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest. But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates, some more than others. Some are unbelievable. And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You'll be amazed. I mean, it's so little. Bush, it's the same thing. And I'll go over, there are other names. I know every one of them. But it's a horrible thing that's taking place. And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they're not even going through the motions. They're not even going through. And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, I want an endorsement. I don't know if they'll give me an endorsement. I'll tell you if they don't they're not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere, I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it. When we can. By the way, it's a great company. It's a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don't have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can. But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it's crooked stuff. It's crooked stuff. And it's got to stop. And it's very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you're supposed to do it, including me. I think I'm the only one that's self funding. I'm the only one putting up my own money, other than, I know it's precious, people write in to or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7, $50, $100. I don't want their money. But if you send it back it's totally insulting. I mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters,Mr. Trump, I can't afford much and I know you don't need it but I'm sending $50 because that's so important what you're saying about the country. It's beautiful. I mean, I've seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there's no letter I can write that's not going to be insulting to those people, really. Dear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don't need your money and thanks a lot but we're going to do it ourselves. If I got that back, I'd say Who the hell does he think he is? So we take that and it's something that I think is important. So I always preface it by saying I don't consider that funding but I'm self funding my campaign and I'm getting ready to put up millions, millions. And something I'm very proud of that I think it's great and it's you know really great, it hasn't gotten very much publicity, hasn't gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don't know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around. But I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I'm number one. Now, until Iowa came along, I said every poll, and then Iowa, what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know? I'm telling you. They said, Why don't you skip Iowa? They told me that. Everybody said Skip Iowa. All of the political geniuses. A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He's actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won't say that. But he is. He's a great reporter. And he said, Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you'd go to South Carolina where I'm leading by massive, yeah, you've got to see the rallies there. They're incredible. But you'd go to New Hampshire. You'd go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC. I said I can't do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we're going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it. And I don't want to skip Iowa. I think we're going to do well. I think we're going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I'm going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I'm the real deal. So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that. So could we do, and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I'm going to win, I'm telling you we're going to win New Hampshire, and we're going to win South Carolina. A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll. But we're going to go on and we're going to win. We're going to win. And actually, one of the pundits, because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said He'll never run. He's not going to run. They're still trying to recover. But one of the very smart one says If Trump wins Iowa, it's over. It's interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great. And I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that's the end of that. But I want to tell you, will you, I refuse to say Get your asses in gear. I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don't want to use anything that's even a little bit off. So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory? And if I win Iowa, we're going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we're going to have such a great military and we're going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that's a nightmare. So, I'm sticking with you people. I'm going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I'm going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it's so important. And you know, it's about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last, right? So, I love you all. I mean, we're having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I'm going to stay here. We're going to work really hard. When I heard the poll today, they said What are you going to do? I said, I'm going to work harder in Iowa. I'm not leaving Iowa. I'm not leaving Iowa. Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you. Okay, let's do a couple of questions. Right? Come on. So, we're going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. It's a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn't seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we've got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven't seen in a long time. We're going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you're single and earn less than $25000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50000,so, very important. If you're single and earn less than $25000 or married and jointly earn less than $50000, you'll not pay any income tax, nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It's a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich, in other words, it's going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true, while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I've been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business, now, so important, because it's all about business. It's all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can't work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount,10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it's called corporate inversion. It's a huge subject. I've been watching politicians now for years, all talk, no action politicians. I've been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back. The number is probably $2 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back, Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can't make a deal. They don't know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn't make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They're leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They're going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons, the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can't bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It's called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can't bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We've been doing this for a year and a half. We can't get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that's what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something, and I've been watching it for a long time, everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes, many of them actually, and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don't make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you, we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we're going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you'll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It's graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they'll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we'll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what's going on in this country. If you look at what we're doing and the money we're spending. I read where a washer, you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer, to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there. And there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money. We will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved. We're reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. We won't be losing anything other than we'll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. So, this is a plan that's simple, that's a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We've already had some very good reviews. I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say Why hasn't this been done before? And this is my wheelhouse. That's what I do well. The economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won't say that. So, if anybody has, thank you. That's amazing. That's some of the press was actually clapping. I've never saw, I don't think I've ever seen that before. All right. Why don't we take some questions from the press? We're doing really well. Iowa's been amazing. It's been amazing. We're doing so well and I love this place and I'm back here all the time and I'm going to be here a lot in January. You're going to be so sick of me. You'll probably say, We can't give the caucus, just forget it. We can't stand the guy any more. No, you're going to like me and we're going to be back and we're going to do a great job for you. Most importantly, we're going to get to that office and we're going to do the right thing. We're going to do the right thing. So, a few things. A lot so much has happened. You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we're just doing so great with the border security. We're going to build a wall. Mexico's going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we're going to have security. And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they're going to come into the country they're going to be legal, they're coming in legally, and that's the way. That's the way. And it affects Iowa so much. So we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It's going to be repealed. It's going to be replaced. I don't know if you've been seeing what's happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It's dying of its own weight. And by 2017, meaning he'll be playing golf and I'll be working very hard. But 2017 instead you're not getting the people signed up. There's been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it. Obamacare's dead but we'll terminate it quicker than that. And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better. Premiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you're close to death, you'll never going to get to use. And even then I don't think you're going to get to use it really. So, we're going to take care of that. And by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really we have the ethanol where are the ethanol people? Right? I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it's so important. And it's another form of let's stay away from OPEC and let's stay away from that Middle East stuff. It's so important Actually what I don't understand because the one guy that's doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he's a nice guy. I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say. I was going to do one really wild but he agrees. But with the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way because he's right now for the oil. But I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He's got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money. But I'm with you. I'm with everybody. Look, I'm self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they're representing countries that are ripping off the country, they're representing companies that are ripping off our country. All I do is I'm going to be working for you folks. We're going to do this thing together. We're going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important. So when we first started, I talked about China how they're ripping us and Japan and Mexico. Mexico both at the border and in trade. They're taking so many of our companies. Nabisco's moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee a great state they took it away at the last moment. I'm not going to let that stuff. We're going to do what we have to do, okay? But I talked about that and I talk about it a lot. The fact is that about 2 weeks ago with Paris, I'm speaking a little bit differently now. Believe me, I can take care of China in my back pocket. That's easy for me. That's what I do. And we have all the cards. A lot of people don't know. You know, these politicians they don't understand we have the cards. You know, with China, our people pay tax. They pay no tax. It's not supposed to be that way. They call it a tariff because it sounds better. But we'll take care of that. We'll take care of all of that. What happened is with Paris, there's a different mindset. And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me. Now, maybe it had to do who knows why? Who knows? But my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there's something that I do that's proper but controversial, they'd say Oh, now he's gone. That's it. That's the end. I won't go over all of the different things because maybe you'll change your minds. But they'd say, That's it. It's over. And then they'd come in, Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week. I said, They did? Because I have to do what's right. I have to do what's right. And you know what? If I don't make it, I don't make it. I have a good life. We all hopefully have a good life. I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. They love me. I think. I hope. I think. But I have a great family and I built a great business. There's such spirit There's such spirit no matter where I go. You know, I go to Dallas. We have 20000. 35000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be for like a record. It is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I'm doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness. Sort of interesting. You know, the slogan is Make America Great Again and I'm adding Make America Great Again and Safe Again because we don't feel safe anymore. And the problem we have now that we've never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It's the power. It's the tremendous power. You know, 100 years ago, I would have said Let's not go. I said Don't go there anyway. And I said it strongly Don't go. You're going to destabilize the Middle East. But the fact is right now, we're going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates. And the press look at all those cameras going all live, all you know, nobody else has cameras like this. They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. Look at this. And don't worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That's why I'm walking around. I figured I'll walk around maybe they'll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them Pan the crowd, they never do. I had a crowd 7000 people last week. More. 7000 people and in a confined space. They had 3000 people outside that couldn't get in. My wife says, Darling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there? I said What? She said, Well, they never leave your face. They keep it purposely. But I'll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can't move them, right? But every time there's a protester Well, I'm protesting and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It's true. It's true. It's true. No, I used to think they couldn't move. You know, maybe there's something with the crazy computers. You know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You'd sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes. Well, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn't think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons. And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn't believe possible. So, they're very dishonest people. What can I say? Not all of them but most of them. I'll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. The Des Moines Register is the worst. They are the worst. The worst. No, they're very dishonest. You have some reporter named Jacobs. She is the worst. She will write so it's such misrepresentation. And so I don't care. I mean, who cares? So I'm saying it right in their backyard. They're failing anyway. They probably won't be in business in two years. I think they're losing a fortune. I think. You know, it's funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly. I'm only doing this so they don't sue me but I don't mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don't have enough money to sue me. That's the good thing. But I believe and I may be wrong in fact, I'll say I'm sure I'm wrong but it's my opinion that they don't do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. I'll explain it You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. Oh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one. Now, I don't know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register? But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don't know why. But we had a great poll come in CNN last couple of days where we're leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa. And then we have another coming where we're doing well. But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it's coming out sometime. I'll just tell you, watch Trump disappears! I think we're going to do so well. I think we're actually going to even do better. You know, we're leading in most of the poll. We're leading in every poll. Except Iowa there was one poll there was one poll, Monmouth I'd never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don't like Monmouth. You know why I don't like it? Because they always treat me badly also. But I only like polls that treat me well. But we're doing so well. Nationwide, we're leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia 44%. 44%. Think of that. That's 44% with 15 people. I'd take 44% if we had three people. I don't think I'd take it if we had two people but I think I'd take if we had three. But 44%. CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we're at 35% to a small number. We're killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here. Again, I'm sure when Des Moines comes out it'll be a negative because I don't believe that poll. But we are going to win. And I'll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, Oh, let's not do I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham. Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out I don't know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there's nobody, nobody that I've ever seen Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody's gone to his crusades, they were incredible. But so I think we're going to do we're doing really well with the evangelicals And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It's true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. I think we're going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We're doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party. And we're doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We're doing great with everybody. And so it's very important for me to win Iowa. Now, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, Oh, I don't care about Iowa. I don't care. But I do care. I do care so much about it. That's why we're here all the time. And then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, The people of Iowa can't be that stupid or the people of the country can't. I'm trying to make a point, right? So I said, The people of the country can't be that stupid. Well, they cut the country out so it's referring to Iowa. I love you people. Remember that. Remember that. I was talking about something, and I won't even mention what I'm talking about because the guy I'm talking about and was actually a very good guy. But I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we'd run the table. I really do. I think we'd run the table. We'd go right through. Because we're leading big in New Hampshire every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It's the weirdest deal I've ever seen. And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, Are you sure about that? Nobody ever called us. They can't believe it. And we can get into that but it's irrelevant. But we're leading New Hampshire big. We're leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We're leading Nevada. We're leading in Texas. We're leading everywhere. We're leading big in Florida. Now, you have Rubio nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you've got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you've got to go and vote. You can't be the number one person that doesn't vote in the Senate. You've got to say, Hey, I'm a young guy. I want to go and vote. You should stay there a little longer. He's a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record. But I don't know. How's he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He's not doing well. How's Rubio doing? Not good. I mean, it seems like a two person race right now and it's an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it's very important. So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we'd just go through. I think we'll win virtually every state in the Union and it's over quickly. Over quickly. What about the Republican establishment? The establishment's got a problem, you know. It's sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they'll go into the hometown of a guy they're fighting and they'll say, You know, we'd never want to get a decision. We go for the knockout. The knockout is the knockout. Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it's a decision and they say, Uh, we're in a problem and they'd lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely knock out. So, if we win Iowa, I think we're going to win everything after that. So I think it's going to show how important Iowa is. I'll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I'll pledge it, okay? I don't think I've ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa's staying right where it is in the chain. It's not moving. You know, there's a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. Folks, I win it's not happening, okay? You're staying right here because it's great. It's great. You've been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way. Let's put them in. Because Medicare does work. With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. We're going to take care of that. Okay? But we're not going to cut your Social Security and we're not cutting your Medicare. We're going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We're going to become a wealthy country again. And we're going to be able to save your Social Security. I can't believe this number but I read it over who is the man that told me the number over 6 million people I can't believe it are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They're dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million now, we know there's not 6 million, there may be one. But there's not 6 million. Anybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand. But so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that's the beginning. So there's tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. What we're going to do is we're going to save Medicare. We're going to save Social Security. We're not going to raise the age or we're not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They're all talking about doing it, and you don't have to. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make our economy incredible again. My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it's gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups. But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated. And when that happens, you're going to see an economy that takes off. We're going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we're going to get rid of it you know, we're at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right. You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn't even a word anybody knew and now it's like routine. So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We're going to bring the economy back. We're going to make ourselves rich again. A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you. I love you. But it's very crude when you say you're going to make our country rich again. I said, I know it's crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can't make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can't let everybody in the world rip us off. Remember, we built China. The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China. You go there, they have bridges all over the they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge. Maybe I shouldn't mention that particular bridge. But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge. Only a few people got that one; that's okay. But they have bridges going up. We have rebuilt China. They've taken our jobs. They've taken our base. They've taken our manufacturing all over the place. They've taken our money. They've taken our money. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen. I know the great business people. We have the greatest business people in the world. Guys like Carl Icahn. He calls me, Donald, I want to help. I want to help. The smartest people call. We're not going to use the special interest guy a donor. We use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. Because again, I'm the only one that's self funding my campaign. Everybody else isn't. These guys when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want. That's not going to happen with me. So, Social Security we're saving it. Medicare we're saving it. We're going to make our country rich. Okay? Thank you, sweetheart. Yeah, it's called the statute of limitations, right? And you know it's a six year year statute. Maybe five but it's probably six. But it's a six year statute. Yeah, you have to look at it. Look, Hillary Clinton you know this story. It's a crime. She committed a crime. Now, perhaps perhaps somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps we'll have some really good Attorney General that's going to say Well, you know. Look, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion. Now, she shouldn't be allowed to run. She's being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they're going to find anything. But they've already found it. I mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, Yes, she violated section so and so. Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws. You mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing. So I think she's going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she'll be allowed to run. She's being protected by the Democrats. She's being protected by the President. And that's why why do you think she's going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything. I don't even honestly in all fairness to her, I don't think she believes it. But I think she's afraid he's going to say, Listen, I don't like her anymore. Go take care of her. I'm going to get somebody else. I'm telling you. So, the question is statute of limitations. It's a five year statute of limitations. She's got a problem. She's got a problem. In one way, she's running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that's the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem. Well, I said right at the beginning. We're going to build a wall that's going to be a real wall. That's going to be a real wall. It's not going to be you see that ceiling? That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. And we can build it and we can build it right. And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. It's got to be beautiful because someday they're going to name it the Trump Wall. I know that. It's going to happen. Going to happen. And it's going to work. And walls do work. You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn't get environmental impact statements. That's just shows you. China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They're not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They're not supposed to be doing that. And you could get them to stop just by saying We're not doing business with you anymore. Their whole economy would you don't have to go to war. It's economics. The whole country would collapse in two seconds. Believe me. We have such power and we don't know it. But they're building massive now, they had little islands. They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they're using Komatsu from Japan They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who's Chinese from China very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? I said jokingly How long did it take them to do these massive islands they're building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements? He laughed. He said, What are you kidding me? Nothing. They say We will build there. About two seconds later, you have escavators digging. So we had a problem with environmental look, I've won many environmental awards. I'm a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I'm a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I've gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I've won many, many awards. But when you look at how we're impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn't get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn't get an environmental impact statement. Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don't know. But they actually had people a lot of people people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn't get it done. You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I've been saying that for three years. Now finally they started after Paris they started bombing the oil. I've been saying it for years. You know one of the reasons we didn't bomb the oil? Obama didn't want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn't want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today. I'm telling you, folks, we're being led by stupid people. We're being led by stupid people. I've been saying not really bomb I've been saying take the oil. I didn't want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said Look, we shouldn't have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way. First of all, we have a president who told them a date. We're going to leave on such and such a date. What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, Wow, because don't believe it. They don't want to be killed. Okay? They don't want to be killed. So the enemy said They're going to leave on a certain date? So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It's a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq. So anyway, I couldn't believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces We are sending 50 soldiers. Okay, first of all, he thinks it's a good press announcement. It's not. 50 soldiers that's not a lot even though they're the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart. Why does he have to say that for? Why can't he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can't he just do that? Why can't he do that? Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don't even know that but everybody is looking for them and that's the way it is. We have people that don't know what they're doing. We used to have General MacArthur Douglas MacArthur General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people. Today, we have generals that go on talk shows I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said and this was serious and he's a good man. They're good men. But you've got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we've been in in decades. And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us. And he said we are in the worst shape we've been in many, many decades. Now, number one, he shouldn't be saying that because you're telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn't be saying it. We shouldn't be saying it. I mean, even if it's true, you don't say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite. One thing I'm going to do I'll tell you, I'm going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody is going to mess with us. You know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing you can do. Everyone is toying with us right now. It's the cheapest thing you can do. The absolute cheapest thing you can do. We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we've been. We have people that knows what's going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on. They saw pipe bombs sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on. When you saw the World Trade Center go, people were putting to planes that were friends, families, girlfriends, and they were put into the planes, and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with families. And frankly that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives but they do care, believe it or not, about their families lives. It's a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I've heard about Simon and Schuster's being a fabulous, I was going to say the Rolls Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You've given us such tremendous support. And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It's been an incredible experience. We wrote a book and the title, Crippled America, is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we've been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. And America is crippled. We owe $17 trillion and now $18 trillion and now it's actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. We have a military that doesn't have proper instruction from leadership. We don't know what we're doing. We're losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they're beating us in trade. And we can't go on like this any longer. It's impossible to go on like this any longer. I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that's not the way it's going to work anymore. So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it's going to be very instructional, very important. To me, it was instructional. When I did The Art of the Deal, I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book The Art of the Deal and the other books we've done. So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what's going on right now. It's a moment of time. And we got it done. And David did a fantastic job. And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in. But we see by the lines, the lines go down to Park Avenue. They've been forming since last night and I'm going to be signing books starting at 12 pm We're doing a couple of interviews and then we're signing books starting at 12 pm and that'll be very exciting for me. But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don't know how they're doing this but they do it. They find a way. Well, I think it's a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I'm leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I'm leading big. A poll just came out in Florida where I'm leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. And I think you know look we're doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we're beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we're beating, they call it the establishment. It's called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. But I don't know. I don't know how his book is doing. Well, I think my book is very hard hitting. His is a different kind of book and he's a different kind of a person. My book is very hard hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it's selling like hotcakes. So we'll see. We're very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I'm different from all of the other candidates. Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we're losing with China, that's going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we're short on with Japan. The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that's right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. So I mean, much different than, you're look at Marco Rubio, very, very weak on illegal immigration. You look at Ben and he's very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can't get rid of Medicare. It'd be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don't know how he stays here. No, I think that really Marco is overrated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn't been able to, Marco doesn't show up to the United States Senate. He's representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I'm way up in Florida over everybody. But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn't show up for the people of Florida, and I don't think he should be doing that. Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush's side and ultimately I think Marco's going to be hurt very badly. And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he's coming from, I think people are going to say, Whoa, we didn't know that. But look at Marco's stance on illegal immigration. It's really trouble for him. I don't see how he can win. Marco Rubio's personal finances are discredited. All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I'll tell you what, I love Florida. I'm in Florida all the time. And for years, I've been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that. But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I've heard about it for years. You'll have to find out. Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his, you know, he certainly lives above his means. There's no question about that. I'll tell you what. On the debates, it's very interesting. Because I don't really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let's get going. Because I don't really care that much. But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect, many of them, not all of them, but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn't asked one tough question. They didn't talk about her foundation. They didn't talk about any of the problems. They didn't talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign. First of all, people aren't going to his rallies anymore. He's finished. So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she'll easily be the candidate. But I will say this: She only got softballs. That's all she got. And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn't the same way. With that being said, I don't really care. Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He's a disaster. And he was, it was such as horribly put question and so obvious. And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it. And all we want to do is to be treated fairly. But with me, I don't care that much. Just give me a podium. What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else. You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn't even want to broadcast it because nobody watched. Okay? Nobody wanted to watch. Now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people. I mean, give me a break. So somebody said, How did they get there? And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well, much better than the political press, they said solely for one reason, it was Trump. I'll take the credit. But I'll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates, enormous profits, by the way beyond anything they've ever envisioned. CNN was going to get $2000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250000. So they went from $2000 to $250000 for a 30 second ad. The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That's what I want. I'm giving them away. I'm giving the profits of my book, I'm giving them away to a lot of different, including the vets. I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women. This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn't see that in the construction trades. I mean, it was totally unique. I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many, a proportion that's close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money, in many cases more than men doing the same job. So women have always appreciated that about me. I've been in terms of employment really a standout and I've been honored for doing so well with women. What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate? I don't know. But he didn't say it well. I like Telemundo by the way. I like it better than Univision. I'm suing Univision for $500 million. Because the country is doing so poorly. It's a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly. That's good. They're going to have some demonstrations. Oh, good because it'll get even higher ratings if they do that. I think it's fine. I think they should demonstrate. Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of the highest rated shows ever. And they're very excited about it. And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics. You've treated me actually very fairly. Won the poll recently in Nevada. Won other polls. And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody. So I have a great relationship with the Hispanics. I have working for me thousands right now, thousands of Hispanics. I've had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me. I'm a job machine. I'm a job machine. And one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close. I'm two, three, and you see that, two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else. And you'd almost say like it's about the jobs, it's about the economy. Then how's anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness? But I've had a great relationship with the workers. I've had a great relationship with jobs. And I've had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics. And I predict that I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. I think I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. I predict, yeah, I think I'm going to get the nomination and I will win the White House. I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad. That's the question I like. How am I preparing for my SNL? Well, I'm meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while. Afterwards, we're going to sign, I guess got thousands of people on line but we're going to sign and then later on this evening I'm meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and we'll start the preparation. We'll pick our skits. Am I nervous? Not too nervous. Not too nervous. But we're going to do a good job and we're going have a fantastic show. We're all going to have a lot of fun. My Jeb impression? No, I don't want to do that. I don't like showing a person sleeping at the podium. Tom is asking Can Jeb make a comeback? I think it's going to be very hard. Very hard. Not about money. I just think, you know, I came up with the energy. And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track. You can't do that when you don't have that. I think Marco is highly overrated. Highly overrated. He doesn't have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things. Jeb, he lacks the quality that you need. We're talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off. You need a very strong person with tremendous energy. Thank you very much folks, I'll take the job. But and it's so important. And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy. We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President. We have a president right now that doesn't have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he's been a horrible president. We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect. And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion. Well, we just went over that. Honestly, we just went over that. And it's only going to make it harder. You're going to see what we're going to do. You're going to see. But the whole thing with anchor babies, I turned out to be right. A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here. Now, we're responsible for that person for the next 85 years. I don't think so. And by the way, I was right, they were wrong. The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that. And if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country. You would be laughed out of the country so fast. So, that turned out, I was 100% right. We'll have to worry about that. We're going to take care of it, and it's going to be done in a very humane way. But we're going to bring back our country and we're going to have a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall and you know why they're going to pay? And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people. Phenomenal. And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands, by the thousands. Phenomenal relationships. But let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance, $45 billion last year. Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars. They will pay for the wall. And it will be very interesting. And you know what? People are going to come into this country but they're going to come in legally. A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration. Well, walls work. All you have to do is ask Israel. Walls work if it's properly constructed. Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace, all talk, no action politicians, they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it. Walls work. All you have to do is go and see Israel. They will tell you that walls work. We need pomp and circumstance. Our country has no spirit. Our country has no gravitas. Our country doesn't feel good about itself. And the primary reason is we have no victories. I mean, where have we had a victory? Where have we had a victory in trade? Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where we've given them $150 billion and we lose everything. We lose everything. It's a laughing stock. Worst deal. Worst contract I've ever seen drawn. We have no victories. And I do write about it. We need some pomp and circumstance. We need spirit. We need a cheerleader. I thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. He's not. He's been a great divider for the country. He's been one of the great dividers of all time. I'm not saying dress. It has nothing to do with dress. It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive. He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened. I'll go anyway they want. I don't care too much about the debates. Look, I'm the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway. Nobody else gets the really nasty questions. In a certain way, maybe they're defending me although I will tell you they're not doing it for that reason. I think it's irrelevant. I just, I like the debates. I've had the debates. I've done well in the debates. As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates. Now, I don't know if I did or not but I certainly didn't do badly. But every single poll says, even CNBC's poll said I won the debate. So I like the debates. I think they're good for me. But we have to be treated a little bit fairly. As an example, Hillary Clinton, no tough questions. I mean, why didn't they ask about Bill? Why didn't they ask about all of the different things. No tough questions. Now, that was staged by the Democrats. And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it. Well, we're going to stage something properly also. But as far as I'm concerned, I really don't care that much. I just want a debate. I think debating is a good thing. It's healthy. Gets everything into the open. But you don't want people like Harwood that read a question, blah, blah, blah, that he wrote, that he carefully wrote. He thought he was such, his career, in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened. He could ask about anything you want. I mean, you have to ask about anything you want. Hillary had only softballs. All night long. It was like this, Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park. Are you from Russia? All right. I think our relationship with Russia will be very good. Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago. Right? Putin. And they have one of the highest ratings they've had in a long time. So I'm going to give him total credit. But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia. Now, maybe we won't. But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia. I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin. Well, I think there are a lot of economic issues. We didn't talk about trade. We didn't talk about devaluations. Right? We didn't talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don't even know what it means. But we didn't talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country, massive companies, because they can't get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere. So they're leaving and they're taking their jobs with them. The corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about. These were all things that weren't talked about at the debate. Instead, they talked about fantasy football. I mean, it was a big question, fantasy football. I'm saying what about corporate inversions? $2 trillion at least. I think it's probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can't get the money back to invest in this country. So they don't talk about corporate inversions at the debates. They talk about fantasy football. Those are the few. I was against the war in Iraq. You know, it was very early on. I'll give it to you. Yeah, I have it upstairs Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn't care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That's exactly what's happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I've felt that for a long time. Do I think that it's time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero, in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because that's less than zero. I assume that's not happening. Do I think it's time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out? Yes. There are too many people. Well, I don't want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers. Look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they're at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out. Like, you know, look at me. I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida. 37%? Georgia. I mean, those are real numbers. These numbers that these people have, and I often ask myself. I asked Mark yesterday, What are they doing? Do they do this for their brand? Because I happen to think it's very bad for their brand. I think Scott Walker did a good thing. I think the way Walker, he saw it wasn't happening, wasn't going to happen and he just got out quickly. You know, he was favored. Don't forget. You know. That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win. What happened is he got out. I think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself. And frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems. So it's a great question. People should get out. Ivanka. Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines, it's true, I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka. She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is great. But Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon. They're going to be coming out very soon. Oh, Ivanka is going to Iowa. When are you going to Iowa? Very soon. I would say, I don't see threats. I mean, whatever it is I have to do. Mark is saying What are the top threats to your candidacy? Who knows? I mean, you're in the crazy world of politics. People change their minds. I'm going to make America great again. Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I'm going to do it. I'm going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that's awfully tough to compete with. And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there, I showed some of the developments that, I have many, many more because you can only, Simon and Schuster, you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it's even better but we didn't have that certified yet. So I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that's the kind of thinking our country needs right now. We are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words, I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don't believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership. There are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn't? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven't done anything. Right? They can't even get along when they agree. So here's the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can't do it. That's a part of the problem. No, they all agree. They all agree. They just didn't want to go through the unfair questions because they weren't questions; they were statements. You see, they were asking, they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way. And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC. The question is should the Fed raise rates? They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them. In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen. And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and she's not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn't want to see a big bubble burst during his administration. Janet Yellen should have raised the rates. She's not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn't want her to. And if she does it, you see what happens every time there's even a thought of raising them just a little bit. And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they're making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don't have leaders that know how to say to China, Don't do that. Don't do that. Because if you do that, we're going to put a big fat tax on you. Don't do that. And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn't do it. If you have the right messenger I'm really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections. I'm not watching any of them in particular. I'll be watching them on Tuesday night. But I'll be out there; we'll be out voting. But the election that I'm watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we've ever had in this country. We're so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership. That's a good question. Okay. So, Simon and Schuster came up to me. They wanted to do a book. They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that's what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country. And I said, I'll do it but we have to talk about the country. What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some greatphotos. I'm smiling. I'm happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn't like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It's a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you're talking about Crippled America and you're talking about all of the problems we have, I can't have a big smiley face up there. So that's how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me. I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn't go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me. Okay? Are the other Republicans afraid to debate? Well, some of them should be. Autism has become an epidemic. 25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics. Not even close. It has gotten totally out of control. I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Because you take a baby in, and I've seen it and I've seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump, I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse not for a child. And we've had so many instances, people that work for me just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. I only say, I'm in favor of vaccines. Do them over a longer period of time. Same amount but just in little sections. And I think you're going to have, I think you're going to see a big impact on autism. Speaking for myself, I'm okay with it. I think there's a certain, I know people that frankly there's no impact on their life whatsoever. There are many people. I would almost say leave it up to them. But I would be willing to check it off and say I will not get Social Security As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people. Don't forget, they pay in and they pay in and maybe do well and maybe some people want it. But the fact is that there are people that truly don't need it and there are many people that do need it very, very badly. And I would be willing to write mine off 100%. If I become President, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We'll have more jobs. We'll have more of everything. We were discussing disease. We were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words. It'll just pass on. I don't want to say politicians all talk, no action, but a lot of what we talked about is words and it'll be forgotten very quickly. If I'm President, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten. We'll find solutions and the world will respect us. They will respect us like never before. And it will actually be a friendlier world. And I have to say it's a great honor to be here tonight. I understand and I'm meeting with people that are terrific people. But I have to say something because it's about judgment. I am the only person on this dais, the only person, that fought very, very hard against us, and I wasn't a sitting politician, going into Iraq. Because I said going into Iraq, that was in 2003, you can check it out. I'll give you 25 different stories. In fact, a delegation was sent to my office this evening because I was so vocal about it. I'm a very militaristic person but you have to know when to use the military. I'm the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq. I would like and I think it's very important, I think it's important because it's about judgment. It's about judgment. I didn't want to go into Iraq and I fought it because what I said is you're going to destabilize the Middle East and that's what happened. Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding and he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he's ever done. Now or unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice but he did say that. And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word. But I would say, well, I think it was. And he actually said that. Did you say that? Okay, so I will say this though you was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. I think he was reading them off a sheet. And frankly I will have and I told him I will have the finest team that anybody's put together and we will solve a lot of problems. You know, right now, they know a lot and look at what's happening. The world is blowing up around us. We will have great teams and great people. You have to understand I am not sitting in the United States Senate with by the way the worst voting record there is today. Number one, I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I'm a businessman doing business transactions. I will know more about this and as you've said that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview it was a great interview. You said it; I didn't. I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what's going on in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess. Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well, that I don't like is if you make $200 million, you're paying 10%, you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making $50000 a year and has to hire H&amp;R Block to do it because it's so complicated. One thing I'll say to Ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years. So it's not a socialistic thing. What I'd like to do is, and I'll be putting it into plan in about two weeks and I think people are going to like it. It's a major reduction in taxes. It's a major reduction for the middle class. The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all but they'll pay more. I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax and I think it's unfair. I've made over $10 billion. I had a casino company. Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Chris will tell you, it's not Chris's fault either. But almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or I've filed for bankruptcy, Atlantic City is a disaster and I did great in Atlantic City. I knew when to get out. My timing was great and I got a lot of credit for it. Many of the great business people that you know, and Carl Icahn's going to work with me on making great deals to this country, but whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time, they have used the laws of the land Let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School Jeffrey Sonnenfeld wrote a paper recently. One of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still haven't recovered. In fact, today on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25000 or 30000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe. When Carly says the revenues went up that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal and it really to the destruction of the company. Now, one of the company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that, and Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this: She can't run any of my companies. That I can tell you. Well, first of all, the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars, not television scholars but legal scholars that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that. A woman gets pregnant. She's nine months. She walks across the border. She has the baby in the United States and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don't think so. And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that. We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people, and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They're coming from Asia to have babies here and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby. The 14th Amendment, it reads properly. You can go and it's probably going to have to check and go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court. But there are a lot of legal scholars that say that is not correct. And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no, we're the only country, one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years. I don't think so. I agree 100% by the way with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem for the obvious reasons. They do not. But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done. I've seen both sides but some of the greatest scholars agree with me without having to go through Congress. But if you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem. Well, I think it's wonderful and all but I did it a little half heartedly but I do mean it to a large extent. We have a country where to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was and the way it came out didn't sound great to me. We have to have assimilation to have a country. We have to have assimilation. I'm not the first one to say this. We have many people over the years for many, many years saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish. This is a reporter, not a high school kid, by the way. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important and it's a big part part of it. Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside and I think Chris knows that maybe as well as anybody. They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you live. We have a country based on laws. I will make sure those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run. Because when I ran and I brought this up at my opening marks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And then they found out with the killing of Kate from San Francisco and so many other crimes, they found that I was right. And most people, many people apologized to me. I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. So, we have a country of laws. They're going to go out and they'll come back if they deserve to come back. If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back. We're going to have a country again. Right now we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it and it can be done with proper management and it can be done with heart. I think it's a terrible statement. I think it's going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement I was watching and he said the statement and I said Wow, I can't believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women. One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. We're talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. I'd never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen. And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons. And somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places but certainly North Korea. We're talking about Iran. They're bad actors. Bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime you have somebody right now in North Korea who's got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them and we don't even mention them. Number one, I wouldn't have drawn the line but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility but I think he'd probably didn't do it not for that reason. Somehow he just doesn't have courage. There's something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force and had done something to Assad, if he had gone in there with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world. I think they had a responsibility. Absolutely. I think we have three of them here. I think they had a responsibility. So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria is a mess. You look at what's going on with ISIS in there. Now, look at this. We're fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe, and I maybe wrong in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don't get along with China. We don't get along with the heads of Mexico. We don't get along with anybody and yet at the same time they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and in every other way. We get along with nobody. I would get along I think with Putin and I would get along with others. And we will have a much more stable, stable, world. I believe that I will get along, we will do between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems. We won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11. He's got 1% in the polls. And how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway. As far as temperament and we all know that. As far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I've built a phenomenal business with incredible iconic assets, one of the really truly great real estate businesses. And I may be an entertainer because I've had tremendous success with number one best sellers all over the place with the Apprentice and everything else I've done. But I will tell you this what I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman and that's the kind of mindset that this country needs to bring it back. Because we owe $19 trillion right now. $19 trillion. And you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. I've actually been in politics all my life although I've been on that side as opposed to this side. I've now a politician for about three months. Obviously I'm doing pretty well. I'm number one in every poll by a lot. But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success. When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Gov. Pataki who by the way was a failed governor in New York. A very seriously failure. He wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say and I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago. I've gotten great credit for my timing. And that's what I'm about. I'm a businessman. Did really well. Really well. And Jeb, what I want to do is to put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that and I'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that. I'm Donald Trump. I wrote the Art of the Deal. I say not in a braggadocious way I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all of the world. And I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again, we build up our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life all together. Thank you. Boy, oh, boy. I didn't expect that. You know, Joe Arends and the group called and they said Would you come over and speak? I'm here for a certain reason. You know, it's called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans, hundreds of thousands of veterans, I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that. I didn't expect it. I didn't ask for it. I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They're our greatest people. They're being treated terribly. Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously, that's what's going on is incredible. But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it's not going to happen. And one of the things I thought I'd do and I'd stress so strongly, the veterans hospitals, obviously they have problems. They're not properly run. And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say I'm sorry. I'm going on vacation, believe me, it doesn't get much worse than that. So we're going to create a whole new system. We're going to take this system apart. And if they're not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we're going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals. And you're going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that's going to be broken down into something that's going to be very special. Right now, and you know it, we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen. So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected. To be here is an honor. They don't build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don't do them this way anymore. I actually said what about recommissioning, look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa. By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It's been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They're great. So this is a great ship and that's a great state. I just want to say that we're going to come out with some plans in a very short time. We're going to be building up our military. We're going to make our military so big and so strong and so great. And it will be so powerful that I don't think we're going to ever have to use it. Nobody's going to mess with us. That I can tell you. And we're going to have a President who's respected by Putin, who's respected by Iran. You know, let's talk about for two seconds, let's talk about the Iran deal. Now, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran. Obama talks about the Supreme Leader. Well, I'm not calling him a Supreme Leader. But he said the other day that after this rip off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again. We're finished with the United States. They're taking $150 billion. They're getting a deal that's going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think. They're going to self police, think about that one, they are going to go and self police. They've got the 24 day, they have 24 day provisions. And by the way, what people don't understand, the 24 day provision doesn't start, you know this, right? It doesn't start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there. It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I've ever seen of any kind. So, we are going to do things and this country right. We're not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there's still there and we don't even ask for them. One of them is there because he's a Christian. We have a writer. We have, the whole thing is absolutely insane. You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe, you know, I've been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I've been saying it. But it's possible, the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place. It's possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he's going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance. So we're going to see what happens. We have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration. Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President. And for two weeks, I said, you know, Rush Limbaugh, he's a great guy, he said He has suffered more incoming, meaning the press, than anybody I've seen. So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I'm the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it's a big problem. It is a big problem. So you remember for about two weeks, I said, Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President. And then you found out there's tremendous crime. There's tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country. So the drugs pour in and the money pours out. Not a good deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. The drug cartels are going wild. They cannot believe how stupid our government is. They are making a fortune. The drugs come in. The money goes out daily. And I saw it because I was on the border. I was there. And we saw it. And everybody sees it everyday. And we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership. None. None whatsoever. So, we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall, believe me. You know, a lot of politicians have said Oh, they're not going to pay. They don't know anything about, they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all. So here's the story. So here's the story. I said the other day to one of my people What is the United State's trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China? So let's start with China. Almost $400 billion a year. Now, if you have a company where you're losing $400 billion, you've got to do something very fast. We don't. We've been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. With Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right? They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars, millions of cars, and we sell them beef. We sell them beef. And they don't want it because their farmers don't want our beef. They protest and they send it back. All right? It's not going to happen that way anymore. Now, with Mexico, and I love Mexico. I have many, many people, many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments. Same with China. I have so many people. They pay me millions and millions. What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment? I don't think so. I had the largest bank in the world as a tenant. It's from China. Bigger than any bank in this country by many times. They're from China. The problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they're smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders. I love free trade. The concept is great. But you need smart people. I have the smartest people in this country lined up. I know the smartest. I have Carl Icahn. I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it. They're wealthy because they make good deals like me. I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent. You can't be a politician. Look, I'm fighting some very nice people. Very nice. Even though I'm leading in the polls. But they're very nice people. But they're never going to do anything with these countries. They're never going to be able to do it. It's an instinct. It's something that's special. They don't have it. Believe me, they don't have it. It's just going to be more of the same. So, we are going to make our country so great. We are going to make it strong. We are going to make it powerful. We're going to rebuild the military. We're going to make it so strong. We are going to take care of our veterans. And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day. The other week, two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31000 people showed up in a rainy rough day. 31000 people came to see us speak and we're talking about making America great again. Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20000 people, the basketball arena of the Mavericks. 20000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest. Everybody, think of it, 20000 people, there wasn't one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, There's got to be one. There was a word, two words that used to be used a lot called silent majority. They stopped using them. The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different. I don't think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they're not silent. People are not silent. They're disgusted with our incompetent politicians. They're disgusted with the people that are giving our country away. They're disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job. They're disgusted when they're allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they're standing there helpless and people just pour into the country. They're disgusted when a woman who's nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years. They're disgusted by what's happening to our country. And you're going to look around and you're going to remember who the people are that are here because we're doing something special. This is a movement. We're going to make our country great again. Believe me, we will make our country great again. I love you all. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. It's such an honor. I was called by Sen. Ted Cruz a few days ago and he said, Do you think we can get a really good crowd out here to protest this incompetent deal? And I said, Boy, can we get a crowd. And that was three days ago and look what shows up and I want to thank you. I want to thank you. So, I've been doing deals for a long time. I've been making lots of wonderful deals, great deals. That's what I do. Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean, never. Now, Ted and everybody else have gone through all of the details and we can talk about the 24 days, which is ridiculous. We can talk about the $150 billion, which by the way they get even if the deal isn't approved. They get it just for going to the table. We can talk about the fact that we have four wonderful people over there and frankly they're never going to come back with this group. And I'll say this: If I win the presidency, I guarantee you that those four prisoners are back in our country before I even take office. I guarantee that. They will be back before I ever take office because they know that's what has to happen. Okay? They know it. And if they don't know it, I'm telling them right now. So, I have a story that just came out an hour ago and as President Obama calls him very routinely, he calls him the Supreme Leader. Our President is calling the person who is really the boss in Iran Supreme Leader and I look at people shaking their head; they can't believe it. But it just came out a little while ago, he said Israel will not exist in 25 years. Think of that. He just said this. He also said very strongly, very, very strongly that This is the end of our dealings with the United States. We want nothing more to do with them. We're not going to do anything right here. We made this deal. It's a phenomenal deal. We're not going to deal with the United States anymore. And that's what he just said and this was a very short period of time ago. So, they rip us off. They take our money. They make us look like fools. And now they're back to being who they really are. They don't want Israel to survive. They will not let Israel survive with incompetent leadership like we have right now. Israel will not survive. And then when it's all done or they think it's all done, they come out with these unbelievable nasty statements that Israel won't be around in 25 years and that we will have no dealings and we will have no further dealings with the United States. Now, the people that we were negotiating with and were working on the sanctions, with including and as an example Russia who is selling tremendous missiles to Iran. You know that. Ballistic missiles being sold. All of these countries, all of these countries, are going to do business with Iran. They're going to make lots of money and lots of other things with Iran. And we're going to do, and we're going to get nothing. Nothing. We are led by very, very stupid people. Very, very stupid people. We cannot let it continue. We are a country that owes $19 trillion. We lose everywhere. We lose militarily. We can't beat ISIS. Give me a break! We can't beat anybody. Our vets are being treated horribly. It will change. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. Believe me. I agree. You'll never get bored of winning. We'd never get bored. We are going to turn this country around. We are going to start winning big league on trade, militarily. We're going to build up our military. We're going to have such a strong military that nobody, nobody, is going to mess with us. We're not going to have to use it. I really, really this tremendous crowd. We are going to make America great again! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. The Chairman just left as you probably know and he's been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. And as you know, that's what I've wanted. I wanted fairness. I don't have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. We're leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we're over 30%. We've actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. And frankly, I've felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it's Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what's happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge. So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that's what it's all about. We have to make our country great again. This is a self funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don't need money and I don't want money. And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other. I'm not controlled by lobbyists. I'm not controlled by anybody. I'm controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again. Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing. The question was what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing. Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I've seen that over the last two months. They really have been very fair. No, I have no intention of changing my mind. Well, I think the big thing that's changed is, and it's been obvious to all, number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship. Nobody thought I was going to run and they said Oh, he won't run and he won't put in his papers. And he wouldn't do all of this. I did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It's a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received. And I think the thing that's changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I'd be running for President. So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect. So that was very important. No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge. Well, you don't have to be met when you're at 2%. It's one of those things. That's the way life works. And I like Gov. Chris Christie, by the way. Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up. You saw him. He was here a little while ago. And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly. Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English and I think that while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English. And that's how assimilation takes. And that's how, I mean, whether people like it or not that's how we assimilate and that's how we go on to that next phase and that next stage. And that's how people that don't speak, and I'm not just talking about Spanish; I'm talking about from various parts of the world, that's how they will become successful and do great. So I think it's more appropriate to be speaking English. Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it's a country based on borders and our country is based on laws. And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that. And this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world. When people come illegally, we cannot allow that. And I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That's been proven. And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I've been proven right. And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven't done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will. The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We're a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws. And we will make sure that that takes place. With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States. When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you're not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay. We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen. I don't know enough about it to comment on it. Was she jailed? I really don't know much about it. That's absolutely false. I win at golf. I win at golf. That I can tell you. Well, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody. I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants. Don't forget if I didn't bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn't be asking the question. Nobody would be even talking about immigration. And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor. Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up. But if I didn't bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we're talking about and it happens to be a very important subject. I have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just, we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner. But if I didn't bring it up, nobody would be talking about it. Well, there is gridlock in Congress right now and that's because there's no leadership at the top. You have to be able to lead. You have to be able to get people into your office. You have to get people go to them. Any way you want to do it. But you have to be able to lead. There is no leadership at the top. Signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run. I don't want to talk about that. It's inappropriate. Tom Brady? Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine. He's a great guy. For those of you who don't know him, he's a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete. He is really a very good friend of mine. And I just spoke to him a little while ago. He's so thrilled and so happy. Tom Brady, I think what they've done is terrible. And he's been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it. But I'm very happy for Tom. As far as the Commissioner is concerned, they're having a rough year. Let's face it. They're having a very rough year. Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming. And it's a huge humanitarian problem. And I just say this. This United States has tremendous problems of their own. We have infrastructure that we have to fix. We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart. Our nation's in such trouble. That's why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help. But we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have, health care, which is a mess. You know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%. People are saying This is turning out to be a disaster. Deductibles are through the roof. The deductibles on Obamacare it's through the roof. So we have a lot of problems. We have to take care of our vets. We have to build up our military. Just the other day, Gen. Ray Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness. Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton, and I've said she's the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that's about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place. I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It's going to lead to nuclear proliferation, the 24 day clause, everything about it. We don't even get our prisoners back. You say who negotiates a thing like that? That won't happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump. You'll see it later. Yeah. They don't want to hear it. I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else. You see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person. Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn't supposed to run. I'm this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I'm not supposed to be running for office. The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade. And I'm not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us. China, taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1 trillion and we're paying them interest. We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount, $1 trillion. Now, that's like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That's not going to happen with me. Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I'll be honest. I think he's a very nice person. I think he's a very low energy person and I don't think that's what the country needs. I hear he's going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me. And honestly, look, he's getting the money from special interests. He's getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they're making him do it because he's crashing in the polls. So I don't know what's going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads, I don't know. I know that my life will continue. I just don't know. I mean nobody's ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I've done. You know, one of the things I'm most honored about is that so far everybody that's attacked me has gone down the tubes. You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he's at zero. You have Perry attacked me. Now he's getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he's getting out of the race. He was at zero. Everybody, Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll, the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I'm leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me. Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big. So I don't know. Are they going to spend, he's going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this, they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money. Nobody knows the system better than me. They have total control. You understand it very well because you've been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate. I will tell you this: Nobody's putting up millions of dollars for me. I'm putting up my own money. In fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you're in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like, am I a fool? I feel very foolish. And when I was in Iowa last week, I said What do you think? Can I take, One man offered me, a big lobbyist, offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa, great crowd, 4000 people, I said Can I take it? And would you believe I'm not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won't do anything. And they all stood up and said No, no, don't take it. The fact is I'm the only self funder. I'm putting up my own money. I know there have been some super PACs, 5 or 6 super PACs, where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you're not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don't know what they're going to do. Hopefully, if they're going to do something it's going to be nice. But I don't know anything about them. But just in a nutshell, I'm funding my own campaign. Nobody else's. When people advertise, and I hope the voters can see this. Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests. So just remember that. Our country could be doing much better. We have deficits that are enormous. We have all bad trade agreements. We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared. We have a military that needs help and especially in these times. We have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don't even work. Okay? If anybody saw that report. The phones don't work. They're 40 years old. They have wires that are no good. Nothing works. Our country doesn't work. Everybody wins except us. We need victories in this country. We don't have victories any more. Our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems. I think it's great that Carly Fiorina in the debate. I was in favor of her being, I think she should be in the debate. I don't like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it. They're not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody. But I think they should because there's too many people. Because when you have 11, you're not getting to hear me and you're not getting to hear other people talking and I think that's too bad. I think 11 is a lot of people. But I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate. I think maybe Joe Biden inclined not to get in the race. I think it's going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton. A lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate. I don't know that to be true. But I think it depends on what happens with her. I think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not. Who knows? Oh, he's not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we're very happy about that. We don't want anything, and I told him. I said, I don't know if it's appropriate Reince for you to be here because I don't want anything, You know, you guys will end up saying he's endorsing Trump. So I suggested frankly that I'm fine with him not being here because I don't want anybody to think he's endorsing. As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it's a little bit sad. Don't forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn't have the energy. But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists. And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not, if I were him, I'd spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they're at a point where they're not going to leave because they're fed up with what's happening in this country, but I think they're going to go to people other than Jeb. I don't know. Right now, I'm interested in jobs. One thing, one of the groups, it was actually CNN. I shouldn't say that. But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing. And I don't mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country. You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million. When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people. We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all. Our country can be great again. We have to put people back to work. Would I bring my children into the administration? I will tell you they are very capable. The answer is probably not. But having them in would be very good. They're very, very capable children. The second part I won't bother asking you. It's no longer pertinent. Kanye West? You know what? I'll never say bad about him. You know why? Because he loves Trump. He loves Trump. He goes around saying Trump is my all time hero. He says it to everybody. So, Kanye West, I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I'll have to run against him. I don't know. So I'll take that back. But he's been so nice to me. You people have sort of seen because I've been a counter puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me. No, my supporters are really supporting me because I'm very competent, because they know that I'm not going to let China rip us off. I'm not going to let Japan rip us off. Japan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu, their big tractor maker, and others. We're not going to let this happen anymore. They do, you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you've ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I've never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don't even want it. It's going to end and they're going to like us. In this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It's a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world. I get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico. I love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics, many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships. And in the package that we gave you, you'll see there's a poll and I'm number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics. So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We're going to be great to the vets. We're going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable. All of these things, we're going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that's much better and much less expensive. We're going to get rid of it. We're going to repeal it. It's going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened. But we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we're going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I'll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. And here is your pledge. You know it's a bubble waiting to explode, and I've been saying that for a long time. I've been saying what they're doing in China is a bubble waiting to explode. And just remember something, when it's a bubblewe can't be brought down by that bubble. They've done things that caused it. We can't be brought down by that bubble. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to tell you a story about Nashville. You're not even going to believe it. But it's a very personal story. It's a very special place to me for a very special reason. But maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us. She's 92 years old. We don't talk about age but she's 92. And she looks magnificent. And her name is Beada and she's become very famous. You know who Beada is, right? Beada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful. So, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life. She hasn't seen anybody that really did it to her. And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she's going to vote for Trump. I think, right? Thank you, darling. I really appreciate it. You know, she's become so famous. She's on television all over the world now. I have to be nervous even talking to her, you're so famous. It's great. Beada, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it. Because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we're going to take this country back and we're going to make this country so great again and so strong again. Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville. So, years ago, many years ago, like I hate to say 40 but I won't say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain. And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good. But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that's what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly. I shouldn't say that because you're not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right? But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee. And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything. And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it's one of the great buildings of the world and it's one of the great successes. And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience. And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places, you know, when you're leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you're not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don't want you at all. And we'll talk about the polls in a second. But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let's do this. And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my, it's not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it's so important and it's been such a great, from the day I built it it was a home run. And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee. So, I really, it's an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you. Real honor. So, coming over I heard and I watched television, you know, they have all these cameras back there and they're live. And I guess we're live on CNN, we're live on so many different things. It's always difficult. You know, when you're always live, you've got to change up your speech. You can't make the speech over and over The other candidates don't get covered live ever, except for the debate. So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they'll be even substantially higher than that. So I would've said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN, that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity. When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now, maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research, so many of this, there's so many good, Alzheimer's, you know, there's so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I'm not showing up. You know, it's interesting. So they'll get 2 million, a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they've been doing them for a long time. They don't do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression, it draws flies? That's what it draws. So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television. Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should. So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it's not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don't know. Here's the thing. If I don't do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don't care about CNN. Honestly. No, they're going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera. They're actually very nice. But they're going to make a lot of money and, you know, it's something we should consider. So we'll all consider it together. But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they're DREAMERs. And I said, What about our children? Why can't our children that are in the country, why can't they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that. You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets. You know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many casesare treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have, our wounded warriors are, these are the greatest people we have. And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it's wonderful, you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what's happening. This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that's possible too. They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there's supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there's nobody there. And the veterans, I don't know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying Where are the people? And then, they said, What happened? And they said, This happens all the time. There was not even, nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history, in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor. When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I'm like Get me, I'd go crazy. It's true. Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house? Right? Beada remembers that. You'd have a cold. The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top. And he'd come over to your house, check you out, fine. Those days don't exist anymore. You know, we're in age of Obamacare where nothing exists. By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor's office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days. One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation. Now, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days. So the wait's now the longest in history and that's the way we're treating our greatest people and that's not right and we're going to change that. We're going to change that. We have right now, and people don't know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness. You know, I'm a Republican. I'm a conservative. But I'm just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens, they become weak. You know, they go to Washington, We're going to stop Obamacare. We're going to stop this. We're going to do this. We're going to do that. Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go Oh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'm in Washington. It's amazing. Isn't it amazing? Don't you agree? I won't happen to me, I promise. And if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won't. I promise. I promise. But you know, they show those phony statistics where we're 5% unemployment. 5%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not. But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking. So if you're looking for a job and you can't find it and you stop for a while, you know, after a while you sort of like It's not happening. It's not going to happen. I don't know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay? So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It's hard to believe. We have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money. Japan's taking our money. Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they're killing us on trade. You know that. In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have You know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don't want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It's about doing the right thing. One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we're leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening. We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech, that's like luck. That's from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31000 people and it was the most unbelievable. And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire. Leading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we're leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who's sitting, you have a governor who's been there for eight years and Trump, ? I love Florida and I'm there a lot. What could be in Florida? Great weather. You have great weather but Florida has great weather. Big advantage. But you know, I'm leading big in Florida. But one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I'm leading really big. And in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability, you know, I'm the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say, I think I had one poll where I'm 41%, almost 41%, can you imagine? 41%. There's 17 people. So I'm at 41% with 17 people and they said Trump's at 41% but look, you can't even hear it. You know, Trump says bleh. Nobody knows what they just said. But there are some people that don't like him. It's unbelievable. I'm the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity. No, it's incredible. The press, ayeyayay. Well, yesterday, you might have seen me. I was in South Carolina. I made a speech. I had to bring it up. The New York Times to me is a big deal. You know, I'm from New York. Very liberal paper but that's okay. You know, not everybody could be like us. But it's still the New York Times. Right? We have to admit, still the New York Times. And I'm on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal. But yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator. Low level guy. This one didn't like me. By the way, I think I'm going to win the Hispanic vote and I think, you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me. I love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many, I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They're great people. And I said, I'm going to win. And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don't want people coming in illegally. You know it's true. It's true. So there's this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we're way up and Lindsey at 4% and he's the Senator. I'm at 30%. So I wrote him a note, Congratulations. I'm only beating you in your home state by 26 points. So anyways, who cares. But they did something that nobody reported. They say, Oh but do people like Trump? By the way, this election is not going to be like. I think I'm a nice person. I love people. I want to help people. Women's health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn't important because he didn't want to fund them. And then he said, Oh, I misspoke. But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person. But I think it's actually going to be an election based on competence. We're tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it's time. But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. In another act of political magic, Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative, nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. From negative to positive. This is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don't need, but I want to be sure because if I used the word the incorrectly, they'll say, He didn't, Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month. A feat that Monmouth University's Patrick Murray's highly respected pollster called astounding. Called it astounding. Nobody else wrote about it. That defies any rule in presidential politics that I've ever seen, said this highly respected man. Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he's never seen that before. And you know what? That's because people have heard me and they say You're such a nice person. No, they want, they say he's a man, I've made a tremendous amount of money. I've had tremendous success. And I don't say that braggingly. That's the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is. But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody. And we are more than double everybody. You saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll. I was the same thing. Much, much higher, double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates. And the reason is people in this country are smart. They don't believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people, you know, why are they doing this? I mean, why are they even saying it? You'd think that if somebody's good for the country, and I'll be great for the country because I'm going to make great deals for our country. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. You'd think somebody, even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal. Somebody who's going to make the country, why are they knocking it? Why are they knocking? Why do they fight? You'd think they'd say Let's do it. It's good. It's good for all of us. Because our country is in trouble. We owe now $19 trillion. You know, I've been saying $18 trillion for a while now. But now it starts to go up quickly. And by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in 2016, you want to see bad deficits? You want to see it go up? You're going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it's no good. Have you noticed, and you've seen it yourself, the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility, unless you're close to death, you're never going to use it. You can't use it because the deductibility is so high. But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It's a disaster. And on top of that, it's going to cost the country a fortune. So it's not only costing you a lot of money, it's going to cost the country a fortune. So we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it. But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won't mention names, some of them when they hear my name, I was talking, we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us. Okay? Who came down. And she actually said Some of them when they hear your name it looks like they're a boiler waiting to explode. It's true. Now, number one, they look bad because they said, do you remember the beginning? Like three, four months ago. They said, He's a clown. He's a clown. Just having fun. You know, I went to a great school. I did great. I did, everything was great. I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune. I then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody. I jokingly say but I mean it, the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it's true. Nothing tops the Bible. But the Art of the Deal, great success. Many books, bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers. Then I do The Apprentice. I've never done television. I do The Apprentice. It's one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way. And NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me. They came up to my office, the head of Comcast, great guy, I won't use names. Just say Steve. No, honestly he's a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, Donald, we're renewing The Apprentice. Please, you'll have to do, you have to do it. I said, Honestly, Steve, I'm running for President. I want to make our country great again. I want to make, And they didn't believe me. And I said it four times. They didn't believe me. Nobody believed that I was going to run. Nobody. My wife didn't even believe me, but now she does. But she actually said If you actually say you're going to run, you're going to do great because people like you. She actually said They'd love you but I don't want to brag. But she said, If you actually run, not you may run, you may not run, who knows? But she said If you actually say, So the NBC guys come up, terrific people. I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows. In fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice. So Mark Burnett, who's a great guy, he calls up and he goes I don't believe it. You're not taking a renewal. The word is renewal. I said, That's right, Mark. I'm going to run for President. No, no, no, you have to, nobody doesn't take a renewal. It's unheard of in primetime television. Two hours primetime. Are you crazy? I said, Mark, I have to do this. I've done so well in this country. I have to do it. We can save our country. We can save our country. So anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it. I told them I'm not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced. They don't like me anymore. It's amazing. They do not like me. But it's too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you. You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice, there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, Why do you think that is? I said Because I'm special. And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically, I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing. But so I had a great experience. So here I am, great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said It will never be successful because you know to have a big hit, a really a number one hit, you have to, and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women. And I'll never forget, I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, Truman loses and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump? And I said, Am I so bad? Am I so bad? Tell me, am I so bad? And it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked. So you know I saved those things. But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it's going to be hard. It's going to be a lot of work. It's going to be a lot of time. I wouldn't leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You're elected President. You're in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I'd maybe never leave! How cool is that? He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I'll try, I don't know maybe there's some rules against it. So maybe I can't. But I'll do the fundraisers in the White House. He and his wife left, I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows. And I say why? Why aren't they flying at least the same plane? Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes. More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, Let's do it from the White House. This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don't spend any money of the taxpayers. And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. We're doing our show live from the White House or something. So we don't pay any money. We don't have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you, do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things? With hundreds and hundreds of security and you're closing down Burbank, California. I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say What's going on? You can't move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city. And he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I'm buying which is only a couple of blocks. It's true. I'm building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it's going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say What's going on? How did Trump get it? One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they're the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we're building this phenomenal hotel, Trump International Hotel, right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It's going to open just in time, and by the way, listen to this one. We're under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget. So we're actually going to be opening and it'll be great. But he can use my hotel. I'll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don't have to do that. But you'd say to yourself why, you know, it's a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don't want to waste time. You've got to do this. You've got to make deals. I've got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us. Carl Icahn, incredible guy. Right? Incredible guy. Great deal maker. I've got some of the greatest deal makers in the world. They're all calling me too. They said You didn't ask me. I have these guys calling me up, the best in the world. Now, I know the best. I also know guys that are overrated. I know guys that you haven't heard of that honestly are phenomenal. I know a lot that you have heard of that aren't really that good, that are overrated in my opinion. But they're the best in the world. And they're calling me. They don't want money. They're worth billions of dollars. But when I put, let's say, Carl Icahn and I'll say Carl, do me a favor. Handle China. We're going to make a great deal. No, no, we're going to make a great deal because that's what happens. You know, that's what happens. So, we're going to take back our trade. If you look at China, if you look at Japan, I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships, the biggest ships I've ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything's nice. Except that it doesn't help us. When does it help us? When does it help us? We sell them beef. Beef. And then they don't want it. Because you know, do you ever see what's going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it's very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over We don't want it. They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships. And I say, What are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing. And I'm a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade. When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It's like peanuts. Balance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has, it's probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They've taken our money. They've taken our jobs. They've taken everything. They've taken so much. And they're creating a bubble and you know interestingly we're so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might. And we've got to be smart. I made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China. The Bank of America building in San Francisco, I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows. You know, all these guys come to Forbes. Oh, Trump's worth only $5 billion or $4 billion. Or whatever. He's only worth $5 billion. It's like a bankrupt magazine. They don't even know my numbers. They said, Well, we haven't been able to look at about 400 of his companies. So I filed. Interestingly, they said He'll never run. He'll never run. Then I announced. Then they said, Oh, he'll never file his form whatever. That's a single page where basically you're signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement. I signed my form. And they said, Well, he'll never ever put in his financials. And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, He'll ask for extensions but he'll never show because he's probably not as rich as people think. But actually I'm much richer and I put in my financials, it's true. It's true. And Forbes and another group said, No, no, we don't know what these companies are. I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn't going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It's such a great company I've built. So they said, He'll never put in his financials. I put in the financials. And everybody, they're much bigger. It's a much bigger, you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I'm very proud of it. But they say, He'll never file. He'll never file. Then they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn't really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million? The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more. So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that. So it says $50 million or more. So I checked many of them. I don't know how many. I think there's 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don't know, I think it's 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they'll kill me if I'm wrong. But I'm not sure. But I think it's like 23 boxes. $50 million or more. So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion. So it says $50 million or more, I go 50. So they'll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more. And they add them up and they say Well, he's worth $3 billion. It's really, this is the press. And they have no clue. Those statements aren't really meant for me, it's not meant for a guy like me. But with all of that the statements were so good. They're so good. They're so good. And you know, one of the things I'm doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing? Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets. But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn't know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign. So all over the place, I'm spending millions of dollars. I'm turning down millions. I don't want your money. I don't want your money. Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn't have to make. But they put it up. It's all over CNN. Trump is asking for $100. I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy, Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He'll sell you a car any day of the week, right? And you know the guy is, like 2000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they're serving. So they put up a sign. I don't want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That's hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story, Trump accepting contributions. I can't believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it's like peanuts. It doesn't mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do. The bottom line is I am self funding my campaign. I'm self funding. I don't want to have anybody giving. I don't need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it's not a lot of money but it's great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money. But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1000. But it doesn't amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign. How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? Dear So and So, I'm sorry I don't really want your money. How do you write a letter like that? I want them to invest in it. You know, but they're not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million. I had a big lobbyist asked me to have, he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down. And then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there's a sign, $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they're doing this big thing about all day long last night about, I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that's the press. That's the media. Yeah, the criminal media. I mean, there's truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it's wrong. But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2000 people. It had to be a record. The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don't forget. When I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I'm leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow. You have not been treated fairly. No, you haven't been treated fairly. You have not been treated fairly. You know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back. You people don't. The Tea Party people are incredible people. These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media. It's disgusting. And you will be surprised how big you are. You don't know how big you are. You don't know the power that you have. I mean it. You don't know the power that you have. The Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want. I don't care about names. But the Tea Party has tremendous power. I talked silent majority. But the silent majority is more than Tea Party. It's Democrats. It's poor people. It's rich people. It's everybody. It's evangelicals. One of the things that made me so happy, I'm a protestant. I'm a presbyterian. Right?, is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful, like these polls are great. You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters. They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. What do you have to do that for? Every week they come out with a new poll. Right? Hey, I'm rich. I could hire a hundred poll. I don't want to waste money. You know, why should I pay? I know in one caselike $150000 a month. And you know, then they're arrogant guys. They think they're hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say. You've got to say this. You've got to be politically correct. No way. I don't have time to be political. No, it's true. It's true. I don't have time to be political. You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct. You saw the anchor baby thing. Did you see that with where I'm on? And somebody fromit's the same network, CNN again, he said, You know the name anchor baby is very insulting? I said, What would you call it? And he gave me like nine words. A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that. I said, How can I say that? It's too long. It's anchor baby. And then Bush, Jeb. Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person. Honestly. If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won't talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person. So Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo. You know, don't say this, don't say that. All these things. Pages of stuff. But one of the things, Never use the term 'anchor baby'. So all of a sudden, he's using the term anchor baby just last week. And with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me. They expect me. They gave up. Okay? With him, they killed him. They just killed him. It didn't stop. And then he blamed it on the Asians. He said, you know, did you see that? And then the New York Times did an editorial How dare you attack the Asians? So he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics. He said, Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies. And now the Asians all hate him. It's true. But the Asians love me and I love them. I love them. So he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says, a couple of years ago, Don't use this term, and now he's using it because he has to. Because baby, you know, think of it. Think of it. I want to build a wall. Okay? So easy. So easy. When this clown, Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name, no, he's a baseball player. Ramos. Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player. He's a nice baseball player. But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters. Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming. So I even had liberal people from CBS, I actually said to the CBS guy Yes? and this guy stands up and starts screaming. So when he, and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him. I didn't do anything like, I didn't do anything. Except for the Times. And that's what I alluded to before. The Times said, Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him. I didn't scream at him. But he was screaming at me. And much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don't wear a toupee, and I proved it, I won't bring anybody up. I won't bring anybody up. But I don't. But think of it. I'm in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer, this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of, saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don't. So, I'm on the front page of the New York Times. I can't even talk about it. I'm embarrassed to talk about it. But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million. They didn't mention that. They also didn't mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Did you know that? His daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Oh, you didn't know that. Oh. No, they didn't mention that. No, no. They said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn't. No, he's screaming at me. So we very nicely, and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk. He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit. You know, he's a very emotional man. But, he said, You can't build a wall because you can't do it. So, 2000 years ago in China, we always get back to China, 2000 years ago, the Great Wall of China, oh, we'd like to have a wall. This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don't go through so easy. They built a wall 2000 years ago that's 13000 miles. Think of that. That's a big wall. That's serious wall, right? This was 2000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit, you know, took a long time. But 13000 miles that's a long time. They had no tractors. They didn't have Caterpillars. Of course, today, we use Komatsus because they're made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar's stock is down. It's terrible. We'll change that around. Believe me. Believe me. But, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15, I would say, look we have 2000 miles as opposed to 13000. But you don't need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places. And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn't. Because I'm a great builder. What I do best is build. I'm not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I'm the opposite. I get it built. So, one of the reasons it couldn't get built is because they couldn't get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn't get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall. And they're killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people. Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family. Last week in California, a 66 year old veteran, a female, a veteran, 66, got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66 years old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily. But this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That's why the hat is so successful. The white one, right? But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn't sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing. But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it's rough stuff, it's rough stuff. And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press. Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said Trump has received more incoming than any human being I've ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he's going to apologize and he doubles down. I got credit. I got credit. No, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don't mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right. So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming. In fact that was my first two weeks. I said Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half? I don't know if I can make it. It was brutal. Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they've apologized to me. Everybody says I'm right. And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration. They wouldn't even be talking about it. They wouldn't even be talking about it. And we're going to build a wall and we're going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They're going to be out so fast. One of the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of those gang members. We're going to be, you know, you look at what's going on with Baltimore, you look at what's going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin. You know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys, we need law and order. We need law and order. I mean, they allowed, in one night, that first night in Baltimore, they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren't allowed to protect people. We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be, the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He's a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they're allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me. We have some incredible people. But we have to be tough. We have to be smart. You know, I know you're going to have some bad apples. You're going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it's disgusting and it's horrible. But that's such a tiny percentage. The problem is the good work doesn't get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99%. I mean, the good work with the police. It's 99%. That one little thing. And it's horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don't have to go into them. But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was. But we need law and order. We need our police. They're great people. They do a phenomenal job. They're right now afraid of doing anything. They're afraid. I mean, I know cities. I won't mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don't want to be thrown off the police force. And then you wonder why there's crimes in our cities. So we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it. We also have to focus on what we have, look, Ukraine. I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good. But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries. We're now sending F-22s. That's the newest fighters. The best in the world. We're sending fighters every, Where's Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree. But why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn't hate us. I think he'd like me. I'd get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn't like him in all fairness. They don't have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I'd get along with these people. Think of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they're going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that. So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay? But think of it. So, Ukraine, let's take a few of these things and then I'm getting the hell out of here; I'm going back to New York. Do you mind? Maybe I'll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight. Can I do that? I'd actually rather, I love, by the way, this is not a politician speaking. Believe me. I hope. I love country music. I love it. Hey, Trace Adkins, right? And who else won on The Apprentice? Who else? John Rich. My kids love those two guys. John Rich. And who else? Who did really well? Clint Black. Right? Clint Black. He did great. And my Trace, how good is Trace, okay? You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, Who the hell is he? Who is he? I didn't know who Trace was. I'd never heard of him. And he wasn't a big name. And he came on, just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it nowit went to number one. And then he came to me the next yearbut Trace came to me and he goes, you know, at certain awards show, I won't mention the name, but he said Last year, I couldn't get into the show and this year I'm hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you. Nice, right? I know, nice. But those three guys, they're great and they're just fantastic people. But we've got to make our country so strong. We have to make our country rich again. A person came up and said, Oh, that's not nice. What's not nice? They said rich, you know, to say we're going to make our country rich. We can't make our country great if we're going to be poor. We're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. China, think of this, China we owe $1 trillion to. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1 trillion. How do you do that? That's like a magic act. Right? It's true. Japan sells us cars by the millions. They make a fortune. They come in, they sell us cars by the millions. And we owe them the exact same amount. We owe them $1 trillion. How come if they're selling us cars we owe them money? Think of it. Put on your business. See? I have a natural instinct for this stuff. Right? You know? Right? If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money? But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds. And we're paying interests on them and we owe them money. So, it'll change. It can change. It's not even going to be hard. People don't realize. See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal. People don't realize. Oh, and somebody said Sharon. It was Sharon. Where's Sharon? She gave me such a hard time. Where's Sharon? Where the hell is she? You could have both Sharons stand up actually. Where are they? Both of them. Sharon is great. Oh, did they go after her. She took a lot of incoming. Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming? I think so. Right? Thank you, darling. So, we are going to do something that if I get elected, and again they said I'll never run and now. One guy said, John McLaughlin, you ever watch the McLaughlin Report? I like him. And one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he'll never make it as a President. He'll never get elected. He'll never make it. And John McLaughlin, this crusty guy who I like; I don't know him. I never met him, I don't think. But I like. He's sitting there and he goes, and he got angry, he goes Why wouldn't he make it? You tell me why. He's been a tremendous success in everything he's done. I go all over the world. I see him name. I see his name all over. He's a great success. And he said, I think this is the word, He's a man of great achievement. Why wouldn't he make it? And I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up. You know, because you need somebody of great achievement. You need, I've produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year. I don't have to worry about Obamacare. I take such good care of my employees. I have thousands of employees. I take good care of them. We have great plans. My employees are lucky. They hit the lotto, okay? But I take great care, education and health care, and my people are very happy. But I've done this for a long time, and I've seen ups and downs. I've seen market crashes. I've seen friends of mine go bankrupt. You've never seen, I've never gone bankrupt. By the way, I've used the laws to my advantage and companies. I buy a company. I throw it into a chapter. I negotiate with banks. I kill. You know. And then they say Trump goes bankrupt. These people, they don't have any, Now, when other people do that, when a Carl does it, I mean, they do it all the time. They use it all the time. It's called using your head. It's called using the laws. Actually I did a good job didn't I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said, I do what every other great businessman does. I buy a company, you know, it's one company was sort of interesting. A friend of mine had it. Good guy. And the banks were just killing him. They were mean. And banks can be mean, right? You've got to teach them how to behave, right? So this guy was just getting beaten. And I did him a favor and I called up the banks. And I said Do me this, do this, do this, do that. They said, We won't do that. No, we won't do that. I said, You're making a mistake. Anyways, it's sort of a little bit complicated. I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, Don't do this. I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story Trump files bankruptcy. Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank, ayeyeye. They see me walking down the street and they go Hey, hey, hey. But then I'm good at that stuff, you know? I'm really good at that stuff. But you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage. Atlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar's went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar's? Caesar's filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things. I said, Don't go into Iraq even though I'm a very militaristic person. I said Don't go into Iraq and they shouldn't have because I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get, $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place. We can't even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we're giving them, they're going to take off and they're going to get the oil, they're going to get everything. The oil they don't get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing. So I had vision in 2004, Reuters, actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don't do Iraq. Now, I'm much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use. So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That's called vision. I should get credit for vision. And again, this isn't bragging. Normally, I wouldn't say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? I mean, normally I wouldn't. So I got great credit. I got out. But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they're bankrupt. They went bankrupt. But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it. Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win. We are going to have victories again. We are going to win. In fact, last night in front of the audience and I've never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we're going to have so many victories. And then I said we're going to win here. We're going to win on trade. We're going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody's going to play with us. Nobody's going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody. And we're going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out. In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore. And everyone stood up and said No, no, no, we want to keep winning. If I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything. I will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid. We are going to have something that's so special. And you know, my whole fame is and I'll say it once. We will make America truly great again. And thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much! Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Thank you. Oh, that's so beautiful. You know, now I know how the great Billy Graham felt because this is the same feeling. We love Billy Graham. We love Billy Graham. You know, this all started, we had a hotel and we were going to have 250 or 300 people. And the hotel was great. They called and said, Something's happening here. We can't hold this. This is crazy, what's going on. And then we went to the convention center and they could have 10000 people and we're all set and we're excited. And the next day they said, Too many people. We can't put them in. So we came here. We came here. You know, today if you noticed, we have a stock market not doing so well. We have a country not doing so well. We've been saying it for a long time. We have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us tonight, well, exclude them. But we have politicians that don't have a clue. They're all talk; they're no action. What's happening to this country is disgraceful. And you know, when I announced I was running for President, I brought up the subject of illegal immigration. And I took a lot of heat, that, I can tell you. Rush Limbaugh actually said incoming, He got more incoming than anybody I've ever seen. And two weeks later, everybody was apologizing to me. They saw that I was right. Between what happened in San Francisco to incredible Kate and her family is such an incredible family, Jamiel Shaw, and so many people have been so badly hurt. The other day in California last week, a woman 66 years old, a veteran, was killed, raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed by an illegal immigrant. We have to do it. We have to do something. We have to do something. You know, if it rains, I'll take off my hat and I'll prove once and for all that it's mine, okay? The people that built this country. That's what we have here. I mean, the people that built the country. Great people. So we'll start with a little talk on the illegal immigration, what's going on. We're going to stop it. We're going to build a wall and it's going to be. You know, it's amazing. The politicians 10 years ago, 15 years ago, they all wanted a wall. But it never went. It never happened. Because somebody didn't want it. Probably a lobbyist. You know, all these guys like Bush and like Hillary Clinton, they're all taken care of, I don't know if you know, it's true. No, but when Hillary has $60 million and when Jeb Bush who's totally in favor of Common Core, weak on immigration, right? Very weak on immigration. Wants to let people come in. Although now, he is using anchor baby. You know, he put out a memo, You cannot use anchor baby. Now, because I used it, he's using it. Politicians. But when they have, in his case, $114 million, in Hillary's case, she's got $60 million. Now, I don't know that she's going to make it to the game. What do you think? I'm not sure that she's making it to the game. Some bad things came out today. You know, those classified, you know the word classified. You know, they've destroyed Gen. Petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening here. So it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately. But, we have right now and I just got these numbers today. I said What are they? 7% of all of the births in this country are illegal immigrants. Okay? Can't afford it. And they're supposed to stay. Now, I turned out to be right. The 14th Amendment. You know, I had these guys, You can't change the 14th Amendment. It will take so long. On that I agree. But you know what? An act of Congress, the 14th Amendment, I was right on it. You can do something with it and you can do something fast. You can do something fast. So we have 300000 babies a year. 300000 that you have to take care of. We all have to take care of. And you know, in the case of other countries including Mexico, they don't do that. It doesn't work that way. You don't walk over the border for one day and all of a sudden we have another American citizen. It doesn't work that way. Mexico doesn't do it. Other places don't do it. Very few places do it. We're the only place just about that's stupid enough to do it. So, I decided to run, I've gotten an amazing reception. I have to say, has this been crazy? I mean, it's been wild. I'm a non politician. The other day, I served jury duty. Right? I told you, they had occupation. I refused to put down politician. But I will say this: We have a great politician here. We have a man here who really have been, he's the one person I sought his counsel because he's been so spot on, he's so highly respected. Has anybody ever heard of Sen. Jeff Sessions? He was so great. Such a help. So, I go around and I see so many people and I've been treated so well by the people. And you know, we're leading in every poll. We're leading in just about every state, including Alabama. Big. We're leading in Florida. Could you believe it? We're leading big in Florida. And you know, it's really amazing. I said, Well Florida, I love Florida. It's a great place, right? Right. But Florida, we have a governor and we have a sitting Senator and I'm killing them. How do you explain that? Obviously they're not doing a very good job because that shouldn't be happening. But we're winning in Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas. And then, nationally, we're just absolutely way ahead of everybody else. In fact, you know, if this were another country, we could maybe call for an expedited election. Right? I would love that. Can we do that? Can we do that? I'd like to have the election tomorrow. I don't want to wait. So, the reason that I think we see this receptivity is that I know the game better than anybody. I've been on the other side. You know, I was totally establishment. Was handingmillions of dollars to these characters all the time, right? I was like the fair haired boy. Do I look fair haired? But I know the game. I mean, I understand it. And so many people have come up, lobbyists. I said I don't want money from lobbyists. But recently, last week, a man comes up who's a good guy. I know him. I said I don't want your money. I don't want your money because I don't know maybe I'll rethink it. Should I rethink it? Take it. You know what I should do? How about this? How about if I take his money but in the end, I screw him and don't do anything for him. Is that okay? Can I do that? You know, because I built a great business and I felt sort of stupid. I say I don't want your money. Can I take it please? I promise I won't do anything for him. I told him, I said, You know, I don't want your money because in two years when you come to see me about something I'm not doing it unless it's good and unless it's going to make America great again. Right? Right? But I'm going to have to rethink it. I think I'm going to rethink that because I think I should take a lot of money, are we allowed to give it to charity or something? I don't know. Just take it. Just take it. So what happens is these guys come up and I'm lucky. You know, everybody said he's never going to run. Okay? You know that. Right? And my wife actually said, You know, if you, she knows me pretty well and she also sees the reaction and for a long time whether it's Trump, The Art of the Deal, which Obama and Kerry obviously did not read when they did this crazy deal with Iran. Oh, look, the Art of the Deal. Give me that book. I love that book. You know, I said the other day and it sort of played pretty well that is my second, help her over here, give me that book. There's always the Art of the Deal and that's the real one; that's the original. That's when they use real paper right? You know, I said the other day because so many people they carry around the Art of the Deal because they're begging, they're begging their politicians Please, please read the Art of the Deal when you negotiate with China and with Japan and with Mexico and with Vietnam and with Saudi Arabia and with everybody. You know, right now we have a problem where North Korea's getting frisky. Right? Now, recently I ordered 4000 television sets. I'd like to order them from here. Like the hats made in America. Can you believe it? I was able to find a guy. I had to do that because you know these hats are hot as a pistol. You know that. And they're made in America. And I'm going to give you your book. Believe me, I haven't forgotten about you. But they're made in America. But the other day and now I see today it's sort of pretty hot on the news that our very dear friend North Korea is acting a little bit rambunctious again. So, I ordered 4000 television sets from South Korea, whether it's Samsung or Sharp or LG or any of them. They're all made in South Korea. I paid a fortune and they're wonderful. And they're wonderful people. They're making a fortune. We don't, do we have anybody who makes television sets in this country? I almost like don't think so, right? So they're mostly made, other than Sony, which has lost its way, prices are too high, but they're mostly made in South Korea. So now I see North Korea is acting up. So I see that we are sending ships and we're getting our troops ready. We have 28000 troops over there. And we're getting ready just in case. We're going to fight, we're going to protect. We get nothing. We get nothing. What do we get? We get nothing. Saudi Arabia, and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. But you know, Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day. A day. That's, in all fairness, that's before the oil went down a little bit. But that's okay. These are minor details. But, let's say they were, let's say they're making a half a billion a day. That's not so bad, right? We get nothing. And they wouldn't be there without our protection. Even Germany, Germany's a power. Who has a Mercedes Benz? Anybody? A lot of people. They're a power. They pay us nothing. We defend the whole world. All you have to do, and we want to be nice. Somebody said, Oh, that's like the mafia defense. I said, Don't worry about it, okay? The mafia's not so stupid. All right? They said, That's terrible to ask for money. No, they said it. They said that's terrible. How can you possibly ask for money to defend a country? I mean, tell me, tell me, how crazy are we? Now, we're sending our ships, we're sending our everything. We got, I'll tell you what. Those 28000 troops that we have right now on the border between North and South Korea. That's dangerous territory. They're in harm's way. They're in harm's way. And we get nothing. We get nothing. Other than they're a good competitor. I mean, they compete with us. They take our trade. We lose a fortune with them. We lose a fortune with China. We defend Japan. You know, we have an agreement with Japan where if somebody attacks Japan, we have to come to their rescue. But if we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Do you think that's a good deal? That's sort of like Sgt. Bergdahl. Has anybody heard of Sgt. Bergdahl? The traitor. No, no, the traitor. I call President Obama the five for one President. We get Sgt. Bergdahl, a traitor, who by the way six people at least that we know of, six people were killed trying to get this guy back. Six people, they went after him. They wanted to get him back. So we get Sgt. Bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted for years that are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? And you know, the reason we have crowds, and no matter where I go, the other night, we're in New Hampshire, we had some, New Hampshire was so incredible. The crowd. You saw it. You know, every time I go on television it's got to be live. It's live. I said, Oh, can I have a rest please? Tonight it's live on Fox. Who likes Fox? I like Fox. It's live on CNN. Who likes CNN? And it's live on MSNBC. Well, they're still working. But I said, How come it always has to be live? Why can't they just cover me like anybody else where they go the next day and they show a little clip? Every time I speak, it has to be live. It's ridiculous. But it's okay. Right? We have to suffer with it. But look, the reason I have this really incredible enthusiasm, and I really appreciate you especially with this weather and this heat and everything else, but the reason I have it is because I do know what I'm doing. And I don't say that in a braggadocious way. You people are looking for somebody that knows what he's doing. Whatever it is. I said it the other night, my second favorite book of all time, what's my first favorite book? The Bible. The Bible. And as much as I love the Art of the Deal, it's not even close. We'd take the Bible all the way, right? So, I was saying. So they said I wasn't going to run. And everybody said, Oh, he's never going to run. Never going to run. He's just having fun. Just a good time. His brand, Like I care about my brand. At this point, my brand, I mean, I lose gutless Macy's because I said about illegal immigration. They dropped my brand. They're not supposed to be, they're gutless. They're all gutless. I have to sue Univision. Univision, my poor Miss Universe people, these beautiful women, some are girls, but beautiful women and I get dropped. Think of it. You have these magnificent women who worked all their life to be in the Miss USA contest and the Miss, and two weeks before the contest, NBC and Univision dropped because they thought my tone was a little bit strong. And it turned out I was right. So here's the good news. I sued them both. And I mean, in the case of Univision, I sued them for $500 million. I want that money. I want that money. So I actually put it on the other day, Miss USA, I put it on because it was only fair to the people. And we had it in a small network and it was fun. But who would do that? All because they want to be so politically correct. They actually called and said, Oh, we'll get it back on soon. We'll get it back on soon. You know, in a case of a couple, they said Trump loses NASCAR. It was all over the world. A friend of mine called. You know, because I opened with a strong statement, meaning illegal immigration, we've got to solve the problem. So all over. One day it was NASCAR. Trump loses NASCAR. I said, I don't have a deal with NASCAR. It turned out that I lost NASCAR, you know what they did? They rented a ballroom at Trump Doral. Can you believe it? That was my loss. They had a ballroom. And by the way, I kept their deposit and rented it to somebody else. The next day, I didn't even know I had a deal with them. It turned out they had in one of my places. They're out. The next day ESPN severs ties with Trump. It's all over the world. ESPN, I have friends that called me. He's a great business. Oh, it's too bad about what happened to ESPN. You know what it was? A golf outing at one of my courses in Los Angeles. Can you believe it? This was my big deal. And this was all over the world. I mean, the press. I don't know. Maybe they didn't get it. Maybe they don't get it. I was very disappointed though with Macy's. You know, shirts and ties. It's not a big deal. But they heard they were going to be three pickets in front of the store and they called Oh, we're going to have pickets. We're going to have pickets. I said, Look, in two hours they'll be gone. Believe me, they'll go for lunch. They won't come back. Don't worry about it. It's true. But they said, Oh this is so bad. Can we sever ties? I said, I don't care, sever ties. I don't wear ties so much any more, you know. I didn't like the ties that much anyway. You know why? Because they were made in China. It always drove me nuts. True. But they were good. They were good. But I just hate gutless people. And so the reason that we're getting this receptivity, which is like this all over the place, is because I filed papers and they said I'm never going to run. Then they said I'm not going to sign the big document, which is a one page document which basically you're giving your life away and I signed. And then they said Oh, I can't believe it. The pundits, you know, they get paid a half a million dollars a year to sit there and make jerks out of themselves, right? Call them pundits. Some are great. Some are really incompetent. I could the ones but they're starting to get nicer to me so I think I can't. But what happens is they said He'll never file his financials. He'll never file because he's probably not as rich as people think. I said, Actually, one of the reasons I want to run is because I want to file my financials because they're so good. Because it's true. It's true. So I have like about 102 pages or 98 pages of stuff and they have all these boxes over $50 million, over $50 million. And I filed my financials and they were phenomenal. They were phenomenal. Much better. And people realized, and it was a net worth, and this is not bragging. I'm going to tell you why. Over $10 billion. That's good, right? Very little debt. Very little debt. In fact, to show you how stupid these people, it has a line for income and the income was like I think it's over $400 million a year. Is that good? My son is here. Look at Eric. He could live on that. It says a line, income and it's like, you know, varies with different things. But basically over $400 million a year. Is there anybody that would not want to make that much money in one year here? Well, with it comes responsibility but I will tell you this. The reason people like what I'm saying is because I want to put that energy, whatever the hell kind of energy it is, I don't know if it's screwed up, if it's good, if it's genius, if it's whatever it is, I know how to do things. And I'm not going to do, I don't care about, you know, we're building a great building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite, between, as you know, the White House and the Old Post Office. You know in real estate business slogan, Always get the post office because they were there first. I got the old post office in Washington, DC And I got it from the Obama administration. Can you believe that? Now, that's call dealmaking. One of the most sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration and I got it. And you know what? They did the right thing because we're doing a great job and we had a great statement. They wanted to make sure it gets done. And it will be opening, and here's a little story. It's now under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? And we just finished Doral and lot of great jobs. And my son is here, Eric Trump. And Ivanka. Has anybody ever heard of Ivanka? And I'll let them run it. I'm not going to let them do any big deals. Just relax, Eric. Just relax. Calm it. But you know what? I won't care about that company. My whole energy, who cares? We do a building. It doesn't mean anything. My whole energy, my whole being is going to be to make our country rich and to make our country great again. And I mean, it's my primary, it's my aptitude. I've always had an aptitude for making money. Some people would say That's nice. One person said, Mr. Trump, that's very crass. I said, Why? You said you were going to make the country rich. That's very crass. I said, You have to understand in order to make our country great, I have to make it rich again. We're a debtor nation. He agreed. So I will devote 1000%. I couldn't care less about the Old Post Office. I couldn't care less about any of our stuff. My kids are very good. They're going to run it very nicely. And I just want to make this country so great. And that's what's going to happen. And that's what's going to happen. In Alabama, US Steel, big closure. Or essentially a closure. And I said, Why? What happened? And I went around. And I said, Anybody work there? No, I don't think so. I hope not. But big closure. And one of the reasons is China is dumping so much steel into the United States and other countries also. But China, I love that sign. Look at that, huh? Wow. Wow. Oh, that's true So China is dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country. The government is subsidizing it. It's almost like they want us to just die. And they have no respect for us. And again, like Saudi Arabia, like Japan, I get along with them great. You know, the largest bank in the world is one of my buildings. They pay me rent. They buy apartments. They spend so much money. Am I going to dislike them? I love them. The problem is and I say it all the time. Their leaders are really smart. They're really cunning. They're really sharp. And we have dummies. Right? We have dummies. We have dummies. We have people that don't have a clue and I don't know. You know, some people say they're bad people. Well, I don't think they're bad people. I think they're incompetent people. A lot of people think they're bad. I don't think they're bad. I think they're incompetent. So you look at China and what they've done. And you know, last week and I said this and I've been saying bubble for a long time. You've been hearing it. Last week, they devalued their currency and we're having a lot of hard times because of what they did. And when I hear devaluation of the Chinese currency, you know the word, the sucking action. That's a sucking like the vacuum cleaner. I hear the sucking action. Two things happen. Two things get sucked out of us. Our jobs and our money. Now, think of it. China sells us our product, takes our jobs, takes our base, does our manufacturing for us, and we owe them $1 trillion. That's like a magic act. I call it the magic act in reverse. We owe them money. Japan, and Japan is back. They have Abe, who's the new prime minister. And Abe is really smart. I mean, he's smart. I met him one time. He's sharp. He's negotiating against Carolyn Kennedy. Carolyn. And I was watching 60 Minutes, I'll give you guys a plug, I was watching 60 Minutes and they're doing a feature on Carolyn Kennedy and she's very nice. You know why I like her? Because Ivanka Trump likes her. My daughter likes, anybody that my daughter likes, right? Anybody my daughter likes, we love Ivanka. So, what happens is that they're doing a feature and they said How did you become Ambassador to Japan? And with Japan, the Ambassador is a very important position because we negotiate. You know, you need somebody sharp. We need a killer. Right? A smart killer, not a dumb killer because there are plenty of dumb killers too. You need somebody sharp. So they said How did you get the Ambassadorship? She said, Well, and this is pretty close. You can check it out. Well, I don't know. I wanted a job and I had nothing to do. So I went to the White House and I said, 'Could I have a job? Do you have anything for me to do? And they said, How would you like to be Ambassador to Japan? And she said, Really? She said, I'll do it. She couldn't believe she got it. And then they showed the rest of the show as her being wined and dined by Abe and all of these killers. Wined and dined. She's being feted at dinner, at this, and lunches and breakfast. She'll do anything they want. Anything. So I have the smartest, toughest, meanest, in many cases, the most horrible human beings on Earth. I know them all. They're killers. They're negotiators. Some are nice people. Very few. Some are nice people. But I will put the meanest, smartest, we have the best in the world. We don't use them. We use political hacks, diplomats. We use people that don't have any business ability. We use people that have never done a job. You know, like as an example, Carl Icahn, did anyone ever hear of Carl? He's an unbelievably brilliant tough businessman. So I called him. I had dinner with him two nights ago. I said, You know, Carl, I'm doing pretty well. I'm leading every poll. He said, You're doing great. He can't believe it either. And I said, If I ever get there, I want you to oversee the negotiations with China and Japan. I'll do it. I'll do it. He's like I'll do it. Remember when I said somebody has blood come out of her eyes with hatred? Right? Well, he had blood coming out of it; he will do it. He is an unbelievable negotiator. An unbelievable negotiator. And I know others. I know the best. I know the worst. I know the ones that are overrated. I know the ones that you've never heard about or read about that are better than all of them. But Carl's one of the greats. I mean, he's very famous. He's very rich. And he would love to do it. He'd love to give back. And he knows what's happening. They're ripping us. So they send their stuff over here. And actually, somebody the other day said What China has done to the United States is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. Isn't is an interesting statement? We've rebuilt China. We've rebuilt China. So you know we have free trade. The problem with free trade is when you have free trade, very important, you need competent leaders. That's the one problem with free trade. I like free trade. I'm a free trader. The problem is you need great negotiators, great leaders. We don't have that. So we're getting killed by everybody. I use these three or four countries. We don't make good deals. Everybody's killing us. So we will have unbelievable deals. A friend of mine is a manufacturer, and he's trying to do business with China. And what he's going, and he's a great manufacturer. Makes great products. Better than what they did. They don't want him sending his stuff. And he calls me and he goes, You know, it's impossible to do business. I can't get my product, they're dumping stuff over here, comes in by the ship load. He said, It's impossible. I can't get my product, Finally gets a product in there and they charge him a massive tax which they call a tariff because it sounds a little more sophisticated, right? And he calls me. And he goes, It's impossible to do business with China. Boeing does business with China. And they want all of their intel. They want all of their copyrights. They want everything. Otherwise, we're not buying planes. And they're now building big factories, I don't blame China. I mean, I respect them. Not angry at them. I'm angry at our leaders for being so stupid. I'm not angry at China. And Mexico is the same thing. You know, Mexico is the new China. The other day, Nabisco, Nabisco. Oreos. Right? Oreos. I love Oreos. I'll never eat them again. Okay? I'll never eat them again. No, Nabisco closes a plant. They just announced a couple of days ago in Chicago. And they're moving the plant to Mexico. Now, why? Why? Why? Have you heard? My favorite story is with Ford So Ford, great company. They're building a $2 billion car factory in Mexico. Now, they're closing up places all over the United States. They're building this massive factory in Mexico. So I went to this great school. I was actually, you know, I was totally still am really smart. I went to this great place, the Wharton School of Finance, hardest school to get into. Even then it was hard to get into. The hardest. But I went to this great business school and I get business. And I fully understand. Really good at this stuff. So they're building a $2 billion plant. They're going to close up factories in the United States. They're going to go and build this plant, they're going to sell cars, they're going to sell them back to us, they're going to sell them. Where does that help us? Tell me. Explain. Explain. There's no tax. There's no nothing. There's no nothing. So we're closing plants here. They're building this massive plant in Mexico. Another plant. Also another big foreign car company. There was a plant being built. It was all set to get started. They were going to announce it in Tennessee. You read about it. And this was a couple of months ago. Wall Street Journal. All set to get started. All of a sudden, Mexico took it away. And now it's not going to be built in Tennessee. It's going to be built in Mexico. So Ford is building a plant. I give myself this position. And I say Let's assume that somebody else becomes President. Wouldn't that be horrible? Wouldn't that be horrible? So let's assume somebody else becomes President. Let's assume a very low energy person, very, very low energy. So low energy that every time you watch him, you fall asleep. Yeah, Hillary too. So let's say Jeb becomes President. Not good. Not good. First thing's that's going to happen, like I said, your school's going to hell. People flow over, but forget about that. So let's say that Jeb doesn't want this plant build. So they're going to call him, the head of Ford, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we want to build it. He'll say, Well, we don't want it built. The next day or the next hour, he's going to get a call from the lobbyists and the special interests and his donors and they're going to say, Hey Jeb, we gave you $8 million of your $120 million that you raised. We gave you $8 million. We want that thing done. You can't do that to our people. Oh, well, okay, I'll approve it. It's going to get done. Okay? The plant will get built and that would be it. Now, let's take Trump as President. Okay, is that better? Here's the simple question: Who would you rather have negotiating with China, Japan, Mexico, any other? Trump or Bush? Actually, ah, what a group. What a group. Well, you know, it's sort of interesting. CNN does this big report that came out last week that I was leading in the poll. So it's a poll. And everybody says why don't I have a pollster. What the hell do I need a pollster? Everyday I wake up there's another poll. Right? You know, they pay these guys like $100000 a month and they can't function because unless they go and have it vetted with their pollster, they can't talk. And I say, Why do I need a pollster when everyday there's a new poll and they give like 30 pages? I don't have to get a pollster. What the hell do I need it? But CNN did this very expensive, very well done poll. It's only well done because I was leading by a lot. And they had leadership. I was way ahead of everybody. They had actually I was very good in, you know the thing I'll be great atand I'll do very well at it, military. I am the toughest guy. I will rebuild our military. It will be so strong, so powerful and so great. It will be so powerful and so great that we'll never have to use it. Nobody's going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody's going to mess with us. So, I look at the various things to do with our country. And by the way, one of them, boy, we're going to take care of our vets. Right? Right? They did a poll but they did a poll on like who's one of the most popular with the vets? I was the most popular person. They like me. And I love them. Because you know why? Because for 35 years, these Senators and these, other than Jeff, of course. I take Jeff. But these Senators, these Congressmen, these people in Washington, including Presidents, they have done nothing for the vets. They have done nothing. And we're going to take care of our vets. But so they do this poll, and in the poll, I scored really high marks on almost everything other than, they thought I wasn't a nice person. They said who's the nicest and I was pretty low on that part. And I'm a nice person. But who cares? A woman came up to me and she said, I'm not choosing, you're not nice enough to be President. I said, You know what? This is not going to be an election based on a nice person. It's going to be based on a competent person. We're tired of the nice people. So, I won on the economy. I won on jobs. I won on leadership by massive numbers. Like massive. You've seen it. I won on all these categories. I said, Why do we need an election? We don't need an election. These are such important categories. But I have had an amazing experience because from the time I announced almost, other than the first week. That was a rough week. They were hitting me. But the press, which is by the way largely very dishonest. I have to say this. The political media, I actually think that the political media is less popular than Congress. Can you believe it? And Congress has almost no rating. And in all fairness, because look at all those cameras. They're all live and they're trying to shut off the camera right now. But you know what? They're all live. And so many live cameras. But I will say this. The media is very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while I'll get an honest story and I love it. I cherish those stories. They're not often. But I cherish those stories. They really started treating me much better. Don't forget, when I first ran, I said you know it's amazing. Went to a great school. Excellent student. Smart guy. My uncle was a professor at MIT who was a smart guy. You know, good smart guy. Good family. Do we believe in the gene thing? I mean, I do. Right? You know, I do But then I went out and built a tremendous fortune and great company. I did the Art of the Deal and many books that were bestsellers. The Art of the Deal is one of the biggest selling, maybe the biggest selling, business book of all time. I did The Apprentice. We love The Apprentice. Tremendous. NBC hates me. You know, NBC hates me because they renewed The Apprentice and I said, Excuse me, I'm not doing it. I'm running for President. I'm going to make the country great again. They actually came up to my office and the top people, great people from NBC, and they said, Please, please. They said We had already renewed the show. They had sold most of the advertising. They renewed the show. I said I'm going to run and I'm going to make our country great I'm hired. You're hired! So, I look at the landscape of our country. I look at where we're going. I look at where we've been. We've had a horrible number of years. A horrible number of years. We can't beat ISIS. I watched the general the other day on television, who's just retiring, which is fortunate. How do you think we'll do against ISIS? Oh, I don't know. It's going to be very tough. Can you believe this? General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their graves as you listen to this. They're spinning in their graves. He talks about a hard time. And I look at what's going on with the landscape and I get to meet all of the people that I've met over the last period of time and I want to tell you it's been amazing. It's been really amazing. And I want to finish up with a couple of little points. One of them is the Ford deal. Right? Israel, I love Israel. The bottom line on Ford, I love this story because, so when I get the call, I say, No, no, no. You're going to build in the United States. They're going to say No, we don't want to do that. I say, Let me tell you, sir, you're going to build in the United States. And I will be called by people but I will not have any of their money so I don't care. And they're going say, and I'll call them in and I'll say, Listen, here's the story. You're building $2 billion in Mexico. We're going to charge you a tremendous little 35% tax. 35%. And that tax is going to be for every car and every part and every truck that comes into the United States. And here's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing or sitting, they're going to come back to me the following day. I would say the following afternoon. Let's say 12And I don't need Carl Icahn. This one is too easy. And they're going to come back and they're going say, Mr. President, what you're doing to us is terrible. We will build in the United States. We will build the plant in the United States. 100%. And I'll say the same thing to Nabisco. It doesn't help us. It doesn't help us. When you look at what's going where Nabisco is closing and so many places are closing, when you look at the kind of money that these countries are making and I'm naming a few, I mean, so many countries, we don't have anything left. We're running on fumes. We're running on fumes. There's nothing here. When you look at what happens, they're so much sharper, they're so much smarter, and we're not going to have a country left. We need to have our borders. We need to make great deals. You know, the man in the back just shouted Israel. How would you like to be Israel right now? They relied on us. They're a voice of sanity. They're great people. And we have a deal that is so incompetent, so bad. Think of the deal. We make a deal. Our chief negotiator goes into a bicycle race at 73 years old. He falls, he breaks his leg. That was the good part of our deal. That was the only thing that happened. No, think of it. And I told people last week as I told this last week, I swear to you I will never, ever ride a bicycle at least in a race but I won't ride one anyways. But we have new thing that just came up in the deal. We know all about the 24 day period, right? But the 24 day period, that doesn't start, that clock doesn't start ticking for a long time. For a long time. So that could be forever. So if they're doing something, believe me, by the time we get there, But there's the all time great. First of all, why aren't they giving us back our prisoners? And second, can you believe this? And second of all, the other day it was determined that Iran in a very important section, maybe the most important, right?, is going to do their own policing. They are going to police and they are going to tell us We swear we're not building anything. It's so sad. It's so sad. Obamacare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We are going to come up with a plan and there are so many different ways. You know, you don't know this because you don't think of Obama this way. Do you know who the biggest beneficiaries of Obamacare are? The insurance companies. The insurance companies. Remember I told you special interests and lobbyists, the insurance companies love it. We can have such great plans if we'd get rid of the artificial lines around every state. I have a huge company, and when I negotiate, I like get one group. They don't, you can't negotiate. Some of the people that own businesses know what I'm talking about. The insurance companies are so protected, they're making a fortune. We're going to end that. We're going to make it so competitive. We're going to get rid of the artificial barriers. You're going to get such great plans. And Obamacare, I mean, you look at what's happening with your premiums. I mean, look at this. Look at what's happening. Just take a look at what's happening to the deductibles. They're so high, it's impossible. It's impossible. Trade, we're going to fix it. Health care, we're going to fix it. Women's health issues, we're going to fix it. My wife came up to me the other day and she said It's really sad because people don't understand how you cherish women. I will protect women. It's so important to me. So important. And I heard some of the other candidates, Jeb and some of the others the other day, saying we're not going to fund various women's health issues. Can you believe this? I said, That's the end of his election. Women, I don't think, like that too much. Do we agree? And he said, we're not going to fund women's health issues. A few hours later, he came back and he said he misspoke. Oh, okay. He misspoke. But women's health issues, so important. We're going to end up taking our country. We are going to make it so strong, so powerful, so loved by people again, so loved. You know, one of the problems that we have and you don't see it tonight but you see it is the tremendous lack of spirit. And I actually thought that President Obama, the one thing, he was inexperienced, he never produced a job. Lots of other things. But I actually thought that he would be a great, a really great cheerleader for the country when he was elected. I thought that he would. And he's really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great unifier. Really had. And you look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis last night over the last week, you look at all of the things that are happening. We're sitting on powder kegs. There's no spirit. There's no jobs. There's no anything. We are going to take this country. I am going to be the greatest jobs President that God ever created. I will tell you that. I will tell you. You are going to be so proud. You know, I oftentimes say the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger and more powerful than ever before. And that's what's going to happen. I am going to make this country bigger and stronger and better. And you're going to love it and you're going to love your President. And we're going to turn this place around and you're going to be so proud. And you know our whole theme is make America great again. We are going to make America better than it's ever been and we're going to love doing it and we're going to have fun doing it. And I just want to thank everybody because this has been really, really special. Thank you. Thank you very much! Thank you very much. Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. Thank you Well, it's just, it's going to be very exciting for the kids and I know that the kids are going to go up. We have quite a few children who are going to take rides today. So, where are the children? Get them over here. That's great. I love children. I love Iowa. Great place. I've really developed a relationship with it, and it's an amazing place. Well, I've been doing it. You know, I've been here many times, as you know. And we have a great staff with the whole place. I mean, Chuck and everybody. So I've really been doing it. And actually the venues have gotten larger and larger because we've really gotten some tremendous crowds. We're doing record breaking crowds. And I'm so honored when I saw the recent polls with Iowa, leading by a lot. But we have actually, and we started with the smaller venues and we've gotten bigger and bigger. The crowds have gotten to be enormous actually. I would still do that if it was appropriate. I love my kids. Come here, kids. Does anybody want to take a ride? Looks nice, right? They're going to have a great time. It's a great experience. I do. I have jury duty. Can you believe this? I look forward to it, actually. I have no expectation. I just hope they're innocent. Whoever it is, I hope they're innocent. Well, she's got a lot of problems with the email situation. It's a big problem. If you look at Gen. Petraeus, he had just a tiny fraction of what she's got going and they destroyed his life virtually. So I think she's got some very big problems. I wish her luck but I think she's got some big problems. It would look that way to me. I don't know. I always say you're innocent until proven guilty. But certainly it would look that way. It looks very serious as far as Hillary's concerned. I hope that's not what happens to her but certainly the facts aren't looking for her right now. And if you look at Gen. Petraeus, what he went through on a much lesser level, is I think it's going to be very tough for her. I don't even want to talk about that question. That's a very serious question. And hopefully, you would never have to use a nuclear weapon. Hopefully. But we have to be prepared. Look, the world hates us, probably never like this before. And we have to build up our military. We have to take care of our vets. And we have to have the finest armament. We have to have the finest military and equipment anywhere in the world by a factor of 10. We have to be protected. We have to be so tough and so strong and so smart that nobody will ever mess with us. I'd say hello. Well, we've done so well because people hear my message. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world whether it's China, or Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade in the case of Mexico. Mexico is sort of becoming the new China in terms of trade. So many companies, just yesterday I read where Nabisco, Nabisco is moving to Mexico. I mean, give me a break. So we have to reverse that. We need jobs in our country. We don't have to worry about other countries. We're going to take jobs back from China, Japan. We're going to make our country great again. And that to me is going to be the challenge. And we're going to do it and it's not going to be that difficult. I spoke with Carl Icahn. He's a friend of mine. He's a great negotiator. He will help us. All of the best negotiators, we have the best business people in the world in this country. They'll all help us. And believe me, when I get the right people negotiating with the right countries, we will come out on top every single time. And that's what we need. Well, Jeb Bush is a puppet to his donors. There's no question about it. He's got lobbyists. I know that. He's got lobbyists and you know he made statements over the last couple of days that are incredible trying to justify the war in Iraq. Can't be justified. And then he said skin in the game. I don't know if you saw his recent statement. He said the United States has to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game. We've spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and he said we have to prove that we have skin in the game. I think it maybe one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard. Skin in the game. We don't have to prove anything. First of all, the Iraqi officials are a bunch of crooks, if there's even an Iraq which I don't think there is. Iran is taking over Iraq. It was one of the dumbest things ever. And I think what happened because I understand psychology, I think his brother probably said Hey, you're killing me. That was his war and he looks very bad. So Jeb Bush tried to push back. But when he said we have to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game and we've lost all of those lives and all of that money, I think he should apologize to the families of the people. I was one of the greats. But now I'm on the different side. I know how the system works better than anybody. Many of the people that gave to Jeb and to Hillary and to everybody else, they're friends of mine or enemies of mine but they're people I know. These are not people that are doing it because they like the color of his hair, believe me. These are highly sophisticated killers. And when they give $5 million or $2 million or $1 million to Jeb, they have him just like a puppet. He'll do whatever they want. He's their puppet. Believe me. And with me, I had yesterday a lobbyist called me up. It's a friend of mine. Good guy. Smart as hell. He's, for his client, I don't blame him. He said, Donald, I want to put $5 million into your campaign. I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. He said, No, no, I want to put $5 million in. I said, I don't want it because when you come back to me in two years and you want help for a company you're representing or a country that you're representing, I'm going to do the right thing for the people of the United States and I don't want to have to insult you. So honestly, I appreciate it. I don't want your $5 million. I'm turning down so much money. But if he put it up, I'd feel obligated because I'm a loyal person just like Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush and all of them. I'm not just talking about Jeb Bush. Hillary too. Believe me. Nobody played the game better than I did. I know the game from the other side and that's the way it works. Nobody else will do the job that I will do. I will bring back jobs. I will strengthen our military. I'll take care of our vets. I'll get rid of Obamacare, which is by the way a catastrophe. Look at what's happening with your, no, look what's happening. Look what's happening. The cost of your insurance is going through the roof. Look what's happening. It's terrible. I will take care of people. And I will be better to women. It's another thing. I heard with Jeb, women's health issues he didn't want to fund. Then he goes back two, three hours later and he said oh he misspoke. He misspoke? I will be so great to women. I cherish women, and the women haven't been take care of properly. When I hear somebody like Jeb Bush talking about we're not going to fund, then he comes back because you know his pollsters said You made a mistake. You have to go back and take it back. But he doesn't mean it from the heart. Well, you're going to have to be very forceful action. Very, very forceful action. You cannot let Iran, let me just tell you this, nor can Israel. Israel was sold out by Kerry and Obama. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. You can't have it. When they march down the streets saying Death to Israel, Death to the United States. You can't let it happen. It will not happen. Believe me, it will not happen here. It's irrelevant. Well, you saw I make $400 million a year. So what difference does it make? What I want to do is I want to make the country great. That's all I want to do. That's much more important. My businesses have been so successful. My children are my executives who will run that easily. I won't even think about, I won't even care about it. My sole focus will be taking that brain that built a great business with some of the great assets of the world. I have some of the great assets, Turnberry in Scotland, Doral in Miami, I have some of the greatest assets in the world. Best locations in Manhattan. Trump Tower, 57th and Fifth. That's what I do. That whole, whatever it is, whatever kind of a brain that is will be used to making our country rich again. Trade deals, great trade deals. Making our country rich. And then making it great. We can't make it great unless we make it rich. We have to bring back the money. We're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. So, my whole focus will be this country and making it great. I would do that, yeah, if I had to. Yes, I do. I have the exceptions and I've been open about that. I don't think I've made mistakes. I mean, every time somebody says I made a mistake, they do the polls and my number goes up. So I guess I haven't made any mistakes. Look, when I said Mexico is sending, I was talking about illegal immigration. The people understood it even though the press didn't want them to. My numbers went up. When I talked about John McCain, I was saying how bad he's treated the veterans because the veterans are treated badly. Then they do a poll. Who do you like better, to the veterans, John McCain or Trump? And I swamped him in the poll. The veterans like me better because they know I'll take care of them. He hasn't taken, after 30 years, he hasn't taken care of them. And this last thing with Fox. I mean, I love Roger Ailes. But all you have to do is ask Roger Ailes Who won? So I don't think I made any mistakes. I'm sure I will at some point. But so far, you would have to say Has it worked out badly? Right? That one I haven't heard. That won't happen. She's fantastic though. I'm going to do a lot of things. Almost everything. You want to know what things am I going to do different for this country? Almost everything because that's what has to happen. Everything we do is wrong. The military, we're not taking care of the military. Not taking care of our vets. We're not taking care of our country. We're not taking care of our finances. We're not taking care of our trade deals. When was the last time you saw this country have a victory? We don't have victories. We don't have victories against China in trade. China just devalued their currency. That's the sucking sound. You know what that is? That means jobs and money coming out of our country. What they did with that devaluation, the biggest devaluation they've had in two decades. They're killing us. They won't be doing it when I'm watching. And I think our people have no idea what's happening This is absolutely unbelievable. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. So this began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix. And the hotel called us up and they said, Please don't do it here. We're going to be swamped. It's going to destroy the building. It's been amazing. And outside, sadly, we have thousands of people that can't get in. So you know real estate. You know real estate. I want to thank everybody. You know, last night, and a lot of you saw it on television, it was actually carried live, we had an amazing event and a very sad event. And yet, very beautiful. Because the word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to. We have a situation that's absolutely out of control. We have incompetent politicians, not only the President. I mean, right here in your own state, you have John McCain. I just hate to see when people don't have common sense, don't have an understanding of what's going on, or perhaps don't want to know. Maybe it's campaign contributions. Maybe it's special interest. Maybe it's lobbyists. But for some reason, some people don't get it and I don't think they'll be in office much longer. I really mean that. We are going to make this country so great again. We are going to work so hard. And I will say this: When we had our event last night, I saw hardened veteran reporters who were crying. You had to see this. People that I've known for a long time that I don't even like, they're not good people. How are you doing back there? And one in particular, tears are streaming down his face and I'm saying, I don't believe what I'm seeing. I didn't think he had a tear in him. And some of the people that spoke were absolutely amazing. One, their child was killed by an illegal immigrant, shouldn't have been here. And this began for me, it's very interesting because when I started and when I announced, don't forget, everybody said, He's never going to run. Right? Then they said very strongly, you know, these are very knowledgeable people; they don't know anything. Then they said, He'll never file his FEC paper. I filed that two weeks ago. They said, Oh, wow. Then they said, He'll never file his financials because he's not as rich as people think. And they get filed during this week. And by the way, some of the other candidates will not be filing from what I hear. Okay? And when they filed, the number is actually much higher than anybody ever knew. And I'm not saying that to brag. I'm only saying that because that is the kind of thinking our country needs. We need thinking where trade deals with China, with Japan, with India, with everybody. We're getting ripped. We're being taken apart piece by piece, slowly. Slowly. China laughs at us. They laugh at our stupidity. They laugh at our incompetent politicians. They have geniuses negotiating for them. We have people who don't have a clue; they don't have a clue. Mexico, and by the way. Officially, and I've only said this about 200 times but it never gets reported. I love the Mexican people. I love the spirit of the Mexican people. I love them. Many, many people from Mexico, legal. They went in the old fashioned way. They're legal. Many, many people from Mexico work for me. And over the years, thousands of people, Hispanics, have worked for me. And many, many work for me now by thousands. They're incredible people. By the way, nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says that. They always cut that out. And I'll go a step further. I respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders, and they're killing us at the border and they're killing us in trade. They're killing us. And every once in a while I'll see a rally and it's put up by the Mexican government in my opinion. People come in. They're so perfect. They're like central casting. And you know how long the rallies last? Like about 12 minutes. They go home. But when you do, I've said this often. It's very, very hard for a very successful person, and I've heard it from the time I was a little boy, to run for President or even political office. And I find it and I have headlines everyday. ESPN drops Trump. A friend of mine in Paris called. Oh Don, it's too bad about ESPN. You know what they were doing? They rented my golf club for a day. They put up a big deposit. I took their deposit. And then I rented it to somebody else. I made two for the price of one. No, it's true. Then the next day all over the world, NASCAR drops Trump. NASCAR. NASCAR. And then friends of mine call up from Europe. Headlines, NASCAR. Don, it's too bad about NASCAR. I feel so, You know what that one was? They rented a banquet hall at Trump National Doral in Miami for one evening. I took their deposit, I took their deposit. And you know what? I just rented it for much more money than they were paying. So it's two for the price of one. You know, I may make money running for President. It's very interesting. Then all over the place, I hear Macy's. Now, Macy's hurts because the head of Macy's I thought was a great friend of mine, Terry Lundgren. Nice guy. He called me up, and I'm in New Hampshire and I'm getting ready to go on to make a speech. Sort of interesting. It's like 6:30 in the evening, and I get a call from Terry Lundgren of Macy's. And the speech is packed. It was a house. It was supposed to be in the house. They didn't have enough room. They had 300, 400 people and they never thought this was going to happen. They thought there were going to be 30 like this. This is a little larger but the same thing proportionally. So my phone rings, my cell phone, and it's Terry Lundgren of Macy's. And the man on stage is getting ready to introduce me. And he said, And you know, we have Donald Trump, the American dream and blah, blah, blah, blah, everything. And my phone rings during the introduction. I'm going to be going up there like in a minute. And he goes, Donald, hi. He's like my best friend. I said, Terry, what's your problem? He said, You're very controversial. He said, and I'm supposed to be going up. I'm supposed to make a speech. I got all these people. And by the way, cameras, just like all these cameras, you have all these cameras, we're on live television all over the place like we are now. And he said, Donald, I had calls from Hispanic people saying they're going to boycott Macy's. I don't know what to do. I said, Terry, be tough. They'll be gone. One day, one day. Now, this is a man I played golf with. I'm with him all the time. I mean, really was, was, was, you understand, because I don't forget things He said to me, Please, please, Donald. Can I cut you? It's not a big deal. I'm selling ties. And honestly, you know what? They were made in China so I didn't care that much. I was like screw it. So I'm walking up the stairs to make a speech and I have Lundgren saying I'd like to cut you because he's going to get some bad publicity, he thinks. And I walked upstairs and he said, And now the American dream. And I'm still talking to Lundgren, and it's like a minute and a half before I walk on stage. People said, What happened? And I made a good speech. No notes. No nothing. And everybody was happy. And I just got cut from Macy's. And here's the bottom line on Macy's. Thousands and thousands of people are cutting up their Macy's credit card. Thousands. Then I get a call from NBC. Now, let me tell you about NBC. No, no, I got to tell you. Hey, look, I love the people at NBC. We had a tremendous success with The Apprentice. And they renewed The Apprentice. See? I give up a lot. You're going to see how much money I made with The Apprentice come Wednesday or Thursday when I do my filing. Seriously. It's a very lucrative, you know, it's great when you have a big television show. It's like, you know, you're a movie star; you get a lot of money. Right? Not that much but a lot. But you're going to see very impressive numbers. So NBC calls me, We'd like to see you. Now, they don't care about inclusion. They were talking about inclusion. You know, they write their press release. So, I read this and I say, This is incredible. But they called me and a couple of months ago the head of NBC comes to see me. And the head of NBC's boss, I don't want to mention names because they're really good people. They're friends of mine although I'll probably never speak to them again either. And you know, the head of NBC's boss, that's Comcast because they own NBC. So I get a call, the head of reality for NBC, the head president of NBC, and the head of everything, the head of Comcast. And they come to see me a number of months ago, Please do The Apprentice. Please. They won't deny it. They won't deny it. I said, I can't. I want to make America great again. I've done The Apprentice now for 12 years and it's a great show. For 12 years. There have 14 or 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every one have failed. Every single one. I mean, I could give you names but I don't want to embarrass people. Nah, give you a couple of names. No, nice people. Mark Cuban did one called The Benefactor. It was a disaster. Richard Branson did one. Great guy but it didn't work out. Tommy Hilfiger, who I love. A tenant in my building. Great guy. Didn't work out. Hiltons did one. Martha Stewart did one for us. Did one for Mark Burnett and Donald Trump. Martha Stewart. She'd just got out of the can. No, it's true. She's hot as a pistol. You know, they showed her coming out. You know, she's got the whole thing with the whole outfit that she's wearing. The whole thing. I said, What a great idea. So we actually did The Apprentice done by us. It wasn't even a copy. It was called The Apprentice. Within a couple of shows it was over. It was over. So I must have something, right? I must have. So here's the story. NBC sees this. I mean, they're smart people. So NBC comes to my office and they want me to do The Apprentice so badly. And what do I do? I said, I can't. I'm going to run for President. And I said, Because of equal time, Now, you know what equal time. Such a stupid law. Obama can go on television all day long and be President and run for office. But if I have a television show, what happens is everybody running for office would have to be able to do The Apprentice. Equal time. So you'll have a good guy named Rick Santorum. You'll have all these guys. You'll have somebody who used to head up Lehman Brothers, the governor from Ohio. Headed up Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers almost took down the world. He was a managing partner. I think he's a nice man. I don't know. But I know if you're the managing partner of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers almost, you're not looking too good. You know. But all of these guys, they would have to be given two hours in primetime television on Monday or Sunday night. I don't think so. So they came to my office and they said, We'd like you to do it. So important. And by the way, they renewed The Apprentice. It was really very interesting because a lot of people said, Well, how could, at the upfront, they announced The Apprentice, which is good because I always want to be loved, you know? Like when I went on dates, if a woman dropped me, which happened often, I would always like to say or at least in my own mind that I dropped her. Does that make sense? So what happened, makes me feel better. So they renewed The Apprentice and I said I'm not going to do it because I'm going to run for President. They didn't believe me. I said, Why won't you believe me? Why would you give up a primetime show? Mark Burnett calls from, a great guy. Survivor, Apprentice. Great guy. He really is a wonderful guy and a friend of mine. He calls me, he goes, Donald, they're giving you an extension. Nobody turns down an extension. He said, I've never heard of it before. I said, Mark, I'm going to run for President. Nobody believed me. Then I run. And the guys, they're in my office and they said Run and then by September, we'll do something. Do you believe that? Do you believe that? And I said, well if I don't do well, I would have done that. You know, why not? You know, if I'm not doing well, if it's obvious I'm, there's a problem. We just went to number one in the polls. So, NBC went nuts. They renewed their show and they don't have their star and everybody else failed with similar shows. And they're angry at me. So again, don't believe the inclusion. They've got Rev. Al Sharpton working for them. Okay? He's actually not a bad guy. He's a con man. You'd have to understand it. Rev. Al is a con man. You know, tells people I'm going to picket you if you don't give. I mean, this guy is a con man. But I've known him for 20 years. He's fine. You've got to understand who you're dealing with. They've got lying Brian Williams. He's okay. They sent me the most beautiful present a couple of months ago. Hundreds of, I shouldn't say the name because I deal with all of them, but in this case, Titleist. They sent me hundreds and hundreds of Titleist golf balls. Top of the line. They sent them to me. Card, From your friends at NBC. A short time later, they say He's not inclusive, me. I'm more inclusive than anybody. More inclusive than anybody. I then get a call. Univision. Now, Univision controls and by the way, believe me. Univision has a certain power. Now, I didn't know much about Univision. I thought they were very wealthy. They're actually not wealthy at all. They're highly over levered. They've got like, I think, $10 billion in debt. They have to do an IPO. Now, how stupid is this? They could have waited a couple of weeks, done their IPO, and be done. Instead, they do it early. They couldn't do it fast enough because you know why? In my opinion, it's only my opinion, the Mexican government totally tells Univision, it's about 80% of their market, totally tells Univision what to do. Totally. So the Mexican government is not happy with me, to put it mildly. But again, I respect Mexico but their leaders are too smart for our leaders because we have stupid leaders. Okay? And I'll tell you, just between you, just between this little bit of a group, thank you very much So the Mexican government does not care about the border nearly as much as they care about the bad trade deals that the United States is making with Mexico. That's really what it's all about. That's really what it's all about. So, I just sued Univision for $500 million. With all of that being said, we have to be strong. We have to take our country back. We have to run the country properly. So, I'm going to bring up a man who's a great man. He's a great, great guy. I saw him the other day on television. Don't worry. It's okay. You can shout. I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here; I think so. Because I'm telling you, I tell about the bad deals that this country is making. Mexico, I respect the country. They're taking our jobs. They're taking our manufacturing. They're taking our money. They're taking everything, and they're killing us on the border. And Mexico does not like it. So remember this. Don't worry. We'll take our country back very soon. Very soon. So the other day, you know it's funny, I got a great review for a speech, including my opening speech when I announced I'm running for President. It wasn't until five days later that people started saying, Oh he said something, What they don't say is they cut it in the middle of the sentence. They cut it. Because those people, many of them, not all, some are great, but many of them are very dishonest people, meaning the press. Very dishonest. Very dishonest. I'll give you one quick example because I want to bring somebody up for a second who's fantastic. But I'll give you one quick example. I say, and it's fairly standards because I believe it strongly, The American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger and better than ever before. Right? Right? So and I say it usually once during a speech, every once in a while. You know, I don't use teleprompters like the President and I speak from the heart. So I say The American dream is dead but I'm going to make it, it's standard, bigger, better, and stronger. Okay, so now I go home and my wife says to me, Darling, that was such a tough statement. What? I turned on the television. The American dream is dead. Period. Cut. I said, Oh, what a horrible statement. They are so dishonest. They are so dishonest. You know, what I usually do because if you really love this country, you have a very, very hard convincing people what you're doing is right and that you're really smart. And like a lot of us are really smart. I'm like really smart. Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then a long time ago, like the hardest or one of the hardest schools to get into. Did well at the school. Came out, made a fortune. Wrote a book called The Art of the Deal. Did everybody read The Art of the Deal? They say the number one selling business book of all time, which I agree, but I'll say one of them because if I'm slightly off by two copies, they'll say Oh, Trump exaggerated. Wrote many bestsellers. Many. I think 12. So I did a lot of things. But The Art of the Deal was like the number one selling business book of all time. Great. Then I do The Apprentice, became this tremendous hit. NBC was desperate to have it. Forget it. Now, they can put somebody else that lasts. Okay. So ready? And then I hear like Donald Trump doesn't deserve to be on the same stage with some failed Senators, failed governor or something. It's sort of amazing, isn't it? Isn't it amazing? And the poll just came out and I'm tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, Oh that's too bad. How can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible! He's weak on immigration. You know, the sanctuary cities. Did you know that he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can believe this? I didn't know that, I just, five of them. He's totally in favor of Common Core, meaning your children in Phoenix and other places are going to be educated by bureaucrats from Washington, who for the most part just want to pick up a check. Give me break. And he's in favor. I don't see him as a factor and I know it's the Bush name, which you know has gotten us into lots of wars. I mean, in all fairness, not the greatest. But Jeb Bush, I don't get it. So when they said, Mr. Trump, you're in first place. Oh that's good. You're tied with Jeb Bush. I said, That's not good. How can I be tied with this guy? But I'll tell you what, I'm going to bring up a man to just a few words. His son was viciously and violently shot by an illegal immigrant. His son was a star athlete, a star student. He applied to Stanford and many great colleges. He would have been, he could have gone anywhere. And I met Jamiel on television about a week ago. I see this guy. He's mentioning my name. I said, Oh no, not again because I figured he's killing me like everybody else. Right? My wife said, No, I think he's saying some really good things. I said, I doubt it. You know, they're hitting me left, right. I said, I doubt it. But I turned it up and he said, The only man that's sticking up for us is Donald Trump. This guy is great, and we were at the news conference with his mother and his sister yesterday and it was one of the most incredible things. So I'd like to introduce to speak a little bit about his son and how incredible his son was and how his son should be here with us. I mean, his son should be alive and he should be in one of the great colleges and he should be maybe someday in the NFL. But he won't be because an illegal immigrant shot him violently. And this guy is the best guy. He's become my friend. He's been with me for a few days. And just say a few words about your boy. By the way, Jamiel's sister is here too and she told me the story that when Jamiel saw the boy, saw the boy laying on the sidewalk dead, this incredible young man with such a future, Jamiel laid down on the sidewalk and started pounding the sidewalk with his hand and badly damaged his hand. Badly, badly. He couldn't understand it. He couldn't believe it. Just an amazing guy. I mean, just an amazing guy. And he wasn't being heard. He wasn't being heard. And the only reason I heard him was because he was talking on a show and he was mentioning how badly they've all been treated. And then you have in San Francisco, a beautiful young woman, Kate, and killed by somebody that just pleaded innocent. First pleaded guilty. Now he has a good lawyer and went into court and pleaded innocent. And they'll be playing around with him for about 15 years in court and probably he'll get off too. It's a horrible thing that's going on with our country. And these are two people that should be alive. And these are people that shouldn't have been in this country. They flow in like water. And I love legal immigration. I love it. I love it. I think it's great. My wife is a legal immigrant. I mean, she went through a whole long process. It's not easy, and we should maybe make it easier and faster, which I think is fine. And we'll have great people come in, and we'll have them come in from all countries, Mexico, everybody, every place. These are great people. And you know, one of the things that I've seen, because this has been an amazing week, and you know, it's been like an incredible week because I thought I was going to be the jobs person because every poll, CNN did a poll the other day, I'm killing everybody on jobs. I'm killing everybody on leadership. You know, it's like funny. You know, I went through these different categories, the only thing I'm not killing, a lot of people don't like me. I said what difference does it make. This is about competence. Somebody said, You win on leadership by far. You win on absolute economic, financial, anything having to do with the economy. You're like lapping the field. Much, much higher than anybody else. But they said, but a lot of people don't know whether or not they like you. I'm actually a nice person. But I actually said if I'm winning in all these categories, why are we even going through primaries? Hillary Clinton is going to be a horrible President. It's horrible. If she even wins her own primary, which I don't know. And by the way, just so you understand, even then press will say This crowd today blows away anything that Bernie Sanders is having. That I could tell you. But if you think about it, Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. The worst. The world blew up around her. Our enemies are a disaster and they hate us more. Our friends are all gone. They're all gone. They're all sort of like, we don't get along with anybody. Everybody is ripping us off, whether it's Russia or China. You know what we've done? For 20 years, I've heard the worst thing that could happen would be if Russia or China start uniting. We united them because we did things that were very onerous, because Obama doesn't like Putin and Putin doesn't respect or like Obama. And all of a sudden, Russia and China now are doing all sorts of things together. So we've driven them together and I've always heard that's a disaster, and it is a disaster. We have driven them. So, Hillary Clinton was the worst. Now, tell me something, why? Just tell me why would she be a good President? She'd be terrible. Who would you rather have negotiating a deal, a trade deal, with anybody? Trump or Hillary? Well, we have to get there first. So, who would you rather have negotiating a really good deal with Mexico, China, Japan? Trump or Jeb Bush? So, when I started, I really thought it would be, you know, a long slog, and I was okay with it. I didn't think that the immigration thing would take on a life like it has. I made some very tough statements about people flowing through because that's one of the things to make our country great again we have to create borders, otherwise we don't have a country. So it's one of many things. And I've been very strong. It's one of many things. We have to make great trade deals and all. So I said strong borders, one of the things. I said trade deals. Who would do better? I'll tell you what. I know the greatest negotiators in the world. Some are horrible people; horrible human beings. Who cares? Some Wall Street guys, they're brutal, they're miserable. You wouldn't want to go out to dinner, they're terrible people. I love them. I know the best. I know people that are totally overrated. They're not good like they think and like the press thinks. I know people that you never heard of that are better than all of them. I would take one, put him in charge of Japan. Good luck. You know who's our primary representative right now? Caroline Kennedy. You know how she got the job? 60 Minutes, she went to the White House. She said I'd love to have a job. I have nothing to do. They said, How would you like to be the Ambassador to Japan? She goes, Really? And Abe from Japan, who's a killer, he's great. He's already knocking the hell out of the yen, by the way, which makes it even more impossible for us to compete. And he's wining and dining her, and I watch it all the time, wining and dining and just doing a number on our country. A friend of mine is a great excavator. That's what he does. He digs foundations. He digs lots of dirt, Earth. But he's a great excavator. Big. And he always bought Caterpillar. And he calls me up recently and he goes, I'm a little depressed. Why? I just put in a big order for machinery, for excavating equipment. I said, Oh, that's good. Did you buy Caterpillar? No, I bought Komatsu. I said, You bought Komatsu? It's fine. I mean, it's a well known brand. I said, You bought Komatsu. Why? He said, Because Japan has so devalued the yen, brilliant, smart, these are smart people, that it made it impossible. So he ordered Komatsu instead of Caterpillar. This is happening all over the place. Today, in the Wall Street Journal, big story, Ford going to build tremendous plants all over the place overseas. Ford, by the way, speaking of Mexico. Again, I respect them. I wish we had smart people. Ford is building a $2 billion plant. Whoever heard of this? $2 billion in Mexico! So, I'm saying to myself, That's not good. And in addition to that in Tennessee, a big plant, $1 billion, was going to be built in Tennessee. Wall Street Journal. And all of a sudden at the last moment they decide to go to Mexico. It's going to be build down in Mexico by a big German car company. And Tennessee is great and the people were good. They all thought they had it, and at the last moment, it goes to Mexico. So I said to myself, Wow, $2 billion. And they're going to make cars and trucks and parts, and they're going to send them into the United States, no tax, no nothing. Now, I told you, I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was like, I'm like a really smart person. My uncle, Dr. John Trump, was at MIT, one of the smartest people. Great engineer. Great, like you know, smart. Right? For many years he was at MIT. And I'm saying to myself, Where does this help us for Ford to build a plant in Mexico and then sell, without tax, no tax? All that means is one thing, that we don't build a plant in the United States, whether it's in Phoenix or anywhere, because it's being built in Mexico. So I said to myself, Okay, Jeb Bush is President and he knows this is the wrong thing. Right now, we have Obama. He won't call. He doesn't even call to get our hostages back from Iran. Here we are in the middle of a deal and he doesn't call about that. One sentence, I'd say, Before we start, we've got to get those people back. Used to be three, now it's four. Get those people back. They'd be back the next hour. We need the right messenger. The Iran deal is a disaster. The Iran deal is a disaster. They are begging. Our chief negotiator at 73 is in a bicycle race. He falls and breaks his leg. This is the mentality we have. So I said, What would Jeb Bush do? You're right. Benghazi. Another Benghazi. To hear our politicians, John McCain, two days, Oh, Benghazi! You don't hear about it anymore. Hillary Clinton with the emails, Oh the emails!, two days. I'm more disappointed in the Republicans in many ways. They talk and talk and talk. So, Jeb Bush, let's say he's President, ay, ay, ay, so let's say Jeb Bush is President. He knows it's no good to have a $2 billion plant built right near our country. How does it help us, right? So here's what happens. He knows it's no good. He'll have a little pressure. Don't let the plant be built. And he might even say, Don't let the plant be built. Might even call the head of Ford. The plant's not going to be built. And then the next day, he'll be called by special interests that supported him, his lobbyists who push him around like a piece of candy, or his donors who have stock in Ford. And they'll say, You can't do that. I helped you. You can't hurt them. You just can't do it. He folds in about two seconds. So let me say Trump is President. Let me say Trump. So I don't need anybody's money. Actually, people are setting up PACs all over the place. I don't care. If they want to give it to me, I'll take it. Okay? But I don't need money. I don't want money. So I'm doing my own. You'll see that on Thursday or whatever the hell day I file. You'll see I did really well. Much better than anyone ever thought. Just the opposite. So here's the story. So Trump is President. So I get a call from the head of Ford and I'll say, You got to build in the United States. Sorry. He'll say, But Mr. President, really, we don't want, I'll say, Here's the story. Number one, congratulations on your new plant in Mexico. And number two, we're going to charge you 35% for every car, truck, and part you send over. And here's what would happen, here's what would happen. Now, this isn't like 99% sure. This is 100%. In fact, you know the negotiators, the killers that I told you about, these bad people? I wouldn't even bother calling them because this is too easy. I can just do this like, you know, with a couple of phones. So here's what would happen with Trump. I will get some calls. He will say Mr. President, this is terrible. Please! Please! Sorry, can't do anything. Sorry, I don't care. I want you to build here. I want jobs in the United States. So, they would go and they'd call up the lobbyists. Hey, I hire lobbyists. I have lobbyists all over the place. They're great. I want something, go do this. I know the system better than anybody. I'm a donor. Somebody said, Oh, you gave to the Democrats. Of course, I give to them. I give to everybody. I want to get everything done. Everybody loves me. Everybody loves, I give to everybody. Now, in a lot of ways, that's very bad because you know what? That's bad for the country. You know it's bad. But that's the way it works. But I give to everybody; they all love me. They don't love me so much anymore by the way, I have to tell you. But here's what happens. He'll call. I'd say he folds sometimes prior to 5 pm in the evening. But he could be tough and he may last 'till 12 pm the following day. And he'll say Please and five guys will call me that are friends of mine and, you know, who I couldn't care less. I'd say, No, you don't understand. I want that plant built in the United States. I want jobs in the United States. Now, this is just one of many deals. And here's what happens. I wold probably get a call the first day but maybe the second day because they're tough negotiators. And he'll say, Mr. President, would you reconsider? I'd say No. He'll say, Mr. President, we've decided to build the plant in Phoenix. Okay? It's so simple. It's so simple. We have totally incompetent people. Now, some people say they're bad people. I don't think they're that smart to be bad people. Honestly, I mean, a lot of people get angry when I say I don't think they're bad; I think they're stupid; I think they're incompetent. So we've got to take our country back. We've got to get rid of Obamacare. We've got to repeal it and replace it with something good. And we have to take care, and I know this doesn't sound very conservative, we've got to take care of everybody, not just the people up here. We've got to take care of everybody. Okay? Get used to it, conservatives. I love you, conservatives. Get used to it. Let's take care of everybody, please? And by the way, Obamacare doesn't. And if you look at the premiums, the premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles, frankly, you have to get hit with a Komatsu tractor in order to use them, they're so high. We can do it. You get rid of state lines. You put it out. You'll have great care for much less money. The country will spend much less, and we will take care of those people that can't do it. We have to, we have to, we have to! We have to build up our military. I'm in the real estate business, as many of you have heard. You'll see that in a couple of days, by the way. I'm in the real estate business and all the time I get listings of bases for sale, a naval, an army base, a marine. There are all these bases. I said How many bases are there? All the time I'm getting these listings for bases. I said, What are we doing? We are hated throughout the world. China is building in the South China Sea islands. We can't do that because we would not be able to get an environmental impact statement. Can you believe? We'd go through 25 years of being sued by the environmentalist. And by the way, I'd hate to say this. I've been given many, many environmental awards. I get a lot of environmental awards. But we have to take back the heart of our country. We have to do something special. We have to bring back, and let me tell you, in bringing back our military, in bringing back our military, we have to do something else. We have to take care of our veterans because our veterans are treated like their third class citizens and they are the greatest. Now, if you remember a few days ago, Bush was asked the simplest question Was Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? He couldn't give an answer. Took him five days before he said it was bad. Now, think of this. Think of this. Five days. How can you have a guy like that negotiating for you? Five days it took him and finally he said it was bad. Okay? He could have done it in the first three seconds. But it took him five days. And if you think about it, we spent $2 trillion, lost thousands of lives, thousands. We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place. All over. Amazing, I mean, amazing people. So we have wounded warriors all over. We got nothing. And today, Iraq is meeting with Iran to do some kind of merger. So in 2004, in Reuters, anyone from Reuters back there? I'm sure they are. There's an article in July of 2004: Trump said don't invade Iraq. Now, I am more for the military and I am the most militaristic person in this room. I would have a military that's so strong that we would never have to use it because people would say No way we're messing with them. No way we're messing with them. And I'd get along with Putin and I'd get along with China. You know, China, largest bank in the world is in China. They're my tenant. I just renewed their lease. Who speaks worse about China than me? No, I do it out of respect. But China, they just renewed their lease. We would never move to a build other than your building. They love it. But it's called respect. It's called respect. They respect smart things, smart people, smart deals. They have no respect for our country. So with Bush, if you people go with Bush, you're going to lose. I'll tell you one other thing and we're going to wrap it up now, but I'll tell you something. And this will be surprising to a lot of people. Thousands and thousands of people work for me. Tens of thousands. I've give tens of thousands, I've taken care of education, for families. I've taken care of health care at the highest level. I didn't even have to worry about Obamacare because my people do better. My people got lucky but I got lucky too, they're great people. But ISIS will be in such trouble. Oh. ISIS. ISIS, believe me, they will be in such trouble. You know the problem, have to say this. So we're fighting wars and we're backing all these stupid people that, honestly, I don't say they're stupid. They don't care. Like the Iraqis. They don't, they have no love for the country. The leadership, there is no leadership but let's assume there is, they're all thieves. They're all terrible people. 100% corrupt. So we send to one of our so called allies 2300 Humvees. Now, think of it. Normally, you'd send like three. How many are here? We send three. They're armor plated Humvees. You can imagine what they cost. They don't even report because it's probably so high that it's another scandal like the $500 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked and still doesn't work. So we send 2300 Humvees. One bullet is fired in the air, and the people we gave the Humvees to flee and the enemy takes them over. And they're better than the ones that our boys and women have. Because they were the best, they're gone in one day. Remember Yemen, how we had the victory? The big victory? It turned out to be a false victory because a few months later it was gone. If you think that those people, if you think that they want Yemen, take a look at a map with that long beautiful border along Saudi Arabia. They want the oil. Do you remember what I said, and I get a lot of credit for this. They said, He's the one guy, and I'm a very militaristic guy, but he's the one guy that said don't do Iraq because you'll destabilize it and then Iran will take over and then somebody else worse than than Saddam Hussein will take over the rest. ISIS, hey, Saddam Hussein was never as bad as these people. These people are brutal. They're chopping off everybody's heads, especially if you happen to be Christian. They chop off your head. They dunk people with a cage. Did you see that? They dunk them and drown them. These people make Saddam Hussein look like a choir boy. Okay? And I said this in 2004. Okay, now Bush goes in and he makes a mistake. And then Obama, frankly, we might as well have stayed there, but he made a mistake too. And I said, Keep the oil. Do you remember that? And everyone said, You can't keep the oil. This is a sovereign country. You can't keep the oil. I said, Keep the oil. We're in there now. You blew it. You shouldn't have gone in. And every other candidate is fleeing. They're all trying to say, Well, they didn't know. There was intelligence that said this. They all said Do it. I'm the only one that said no. I'm the only one that said No. Keep the oil, I said. I've been saying this for two, three years. Don't leave. Keep the oil. Because if you don't get it, Iran will get it or somebody else is going to get it. Iran is taking it and ISIS has it. And ISIS now is building a hotel in Iraq. They're competing with me. Can you believe it? They're renovating this building; they're building a hotel. They're wealthy. They have the oil. And I said, Keep it. And great criticism. Trump says keep the oil. Well, that's a sovereign country. Isn't it a horrible thing to say? These are stupid people we have leading us. So ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast, it would be, have to do it, have to do it. See, I think they overplayed their hand. I actually think they made a big mistake. When they started, like you take James Foley. So great. Such a great guy. I got to know his parents. I met the parents; they're very interesting They did the beheading and then they've done other, I said, You know, they're making a big mistake, ISIS, because if they wouldn't have done and if they wouldn't keep doing, we wouldn't have cared. We could have been gone. But you can't, not when you see what they're doing, you can't. Had they not done those things, the level of violence, we're like living in Medieval times. You know, when you hear of Medieval time, you always think we were all civilized. It's a jungle. It's horrible out there. But when they started doing the beheadings, they really, I think they made a mistake but not with Obama because he's weak and he's ineffective and he's not respected. Not respected. So here's the problem. Here's the kind of deals we make: James Foley is dead. Great guy. Amazing guy. Amazing parents. We have Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. So we negotiate for Sergeant Bergdahl, a no good traitor. Six people were killed trying to find him. Six young in this case men went out to try to get him; six of them never came back. Six people died and we have Sergeant Bergdahl. And here's our deal. This is just like the stupid deal that we're making with Iran on nuclear. This is just like everything else we do, the deals we make with China, the deals we make with Mexico. We don't know what we're doing. So we get Bergdahl, a no good traitor. Frankly, I'd renegotiate deals every once in a while. Not too often but I'd send him back, and if they don't want him, send him back anyways. I want to renegotiate that. They get five killers that are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including the people in this room. And these were the five people that they most wanted. So I call Obama the five for one President. Who would make that deal? Now, I don't think it's because he's a bad person. Who would make a deal like this? But these are the same deals that we make with all of these countries. When I look at Japan, I just go over from Los Angeles. We had a tremendous crowd there too. We had a tremendous crowd. And we had a big one in Las Vegas this morning. But when I look at these massive boats, I've never seen boats like this, the biggest boats with cars coming from Japan. And then we can't sell corn. We can't sell beef. It's peanuts. We can't sell beef. So we do about 20% to their 100%. So I said it in an idea on the way over. I said, Tell Japan that's okay. Everything's fine. We're going to cut your orders down to 20%. Let it match. Let it match. Simple deal. Simple deal. And I had another idea that's also very simple. When Mexico, and you remember when Fidel Castro took over, the opened his prisons and he sent everybody over to the United States and we accepted them and it was hell. We didn't send them back. We accepted them. In a much, much, much more sophisticated way, Mexico is doing that to us because why would they want to have a prisoner like these two horrible people that hurt so badly, destroyed, but hurt so badly the Shaw family and Kate's family. Why would they want to have them in jail for 40 years, paying for it? So I had an idea. The one with Kate came over five times. In my opinion, he was pushed out by Mexico. They don't want him. They don't want to take care of him. Why would they want to take care of him? And believe me, Univision, which I'm suing by the way for $500 million because they broke the contract, but Univision is doing the work of the Mexican government. And I don't blame them actually. I respect Mexico. I don't blame the Mexican government. I just wish our people were smart. Like they're really smart doing that. They're sending them to us and we're either putting them in jails or letting them go free, which is even worse. But we have to do something. So, I have an idea. I said every time an illegal comes to this country through the border because Mexico was pushing them over, remember that. And by the way, unbelievable people are coming. A lot of people that are illegal are great people. Just let's get it straight, they don't want to give it straight because the press are liars. They're terrible people. They're terrible people. Terrible. Not all of them but many of them. So here's an idea. So, Mexico is sending them. And by the way, they're coming from all over the world including the Middle East. Why not? Come on in. We're stupid. We'll take care of you. We'll pay. Get sick, we'll take care of your hospitalization. What kind of a plan do you want? So I had an idea. I think it's good. Every time Mexico really intelligently sends people over, we charge Mexico $100000 for every person they send over. Now, they make so much money that that's peanuts. It's not a lot. Could have made it much higher but I'm nice. I'm in a good mood today. We charge Mexico $100000 for every person. You'll see that it'll start to stop because that starts to add up. It starts to add up. We have to secure our borders. We have to do something to take back our country. I mean, don't kid yourself folks, what took place today, even by the dishonest press, what took place today is being seen all over the world. Look at all those cameras back there. This is being seen all over the world. People know. You know, it's a term I haven't heard for years but I was thinking about it. It's a term that I haven't heard for years but I really think it applies now more than maybe ever before and that's the term the silent majority. Have you all heard that? You don't hear it. When people start cutting up their credit cards at Macy's and won't go to Macy's anymore, when all of these things, and that's a big story but nobody wants to write it. That's fine. I don't care about me. But when you see the kind of power that the silent majority has and the silent majority is a problem. They want to go out. They want to lead a good life. They want to work hard. They want to have their family. They don't want to be involved in coming here and waiting on a line for hours and hours and coming in and listening to Trump. But the silent majority is back, and we're going to take the country back. And we are going to make America great again! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! 

...Thank you so much.  That's so nice.  Isn't he a great guy.  He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it.  It's just not fair.  And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party.  Also, also the people of Iowa.  They have something in common.  Hard-working people.  They want to work, they want to make the country great.  I love the people of Iowa.  So that's the way it is.  Very simple.
With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.  The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused.  Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.  In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.  Very simple.  Politicians are all talk, no action.  They are all talk and no action.  And it's constant; it never ends.
And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican.  And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians.  Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.  You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to--.  Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
You look at Obamacare.  A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster.  People are closing up shops.  Doctors are quitting the business.  I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.  He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.  And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business.  And he was very successful guy.  But it's happening more and more.
Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.  I have many websites, many, many websites.  They're all over the place.  But for $10, okay?
Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.  It was a filthy lie.  And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted?  Does anyone do anything?  And what are the Republican politicians doing about it?  He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.  You can keep your plan.  And you've all heard that hundreds of times.  That's like the real estate location, location.  I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location.  But you have heard this about Obamacare.
And it's disgraceful.  It's a big, fat, horrible lie.  Your deductibles are going through the roof.  You're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage.  And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore.  So it's a real, real disaster.  And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.
Now, we have to build a fence.  And it's got to be a beauty.  Who can build better than Trump?  I build; it's what I do.  I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings.  Fences are easy, believe me.  I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.  They're walking.  The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.  It is so terrible.  It is so unfair.  It is so incompetent.  And we don't have the best coming in.  We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.  You can certainly have terrorists.  You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.  You can have anything coming across the border.  We don't do anything about it.  So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.


Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.  Benghazi.  Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.  Everything is Benghazi.  What happens?  Nothing.
IRS, e-mails.  I get sued all the time, okay.  I run a big business.  You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful.  I have done so many deals.  Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.  You'll see that when I file my statements.  I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.  But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.  Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many--  Look, Obama, what did he do?  No deal.  He never did a deal.  He did one deal.  A house.  And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay.  He got away with murder.  But I can tell you, e-mails.  IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.  If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost; they can't be lost.  So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?
They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.  Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.  But they talk about it.  And then you have a president that does an executive order.  Nobody even heard of an executive order.  He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.  We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  So we have to do something.
Jobs.  China.  I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.  One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.  And I know them.  And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.  We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.  They tell me that.  Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  But they tell me that.
And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.  I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.  They are devaluing down to nothing.  And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.  And they're getting away with it.  And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  But you watch this devaluation of all of it.  I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.  And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  You know it's one of those things, sounds good.  Be very careful.  Be very careful.  Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  They have it set.  Don't forget another thing.  China became the number one economic power a year ago.  That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  It was absolutely unthinkable.  So it happened and it's very, very sad.
Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.  We got nothing.  They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.  Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.  By the way, you know how they formed.  They took the oil.  And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.  So now ISIS has the oil.  And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.  So we get nothing.  We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  We have incompetent people.  They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.  It needs money.
We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.  'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.  I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.  Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.  And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.
Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  We can't do it.  Can't do it.  We cannot let that happen.  You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.
Here we are in Syria.  We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.  Think of this.  We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.  Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  But think of it; think of it.  ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.  There are so many things; there are so many things.
But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  The power.  And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  We've never had this before.
We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.  We're trying to do the right thing.  We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.  The same thing is happening there.  And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.  They're taking it out.  Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  It's really, really crazy.


So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.  Bridges are collapsing all over the country.  The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure.
I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.  I go to various different places.  I go to China.  They are building a bridge on every corner.  They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.  They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but I've always said "qatar" so I'll keep it "qatar" what the hell.  But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.  The place is falling apart.  You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.  And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  This is inside, not outside.  And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.  In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.  I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.  But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling.
You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  You know the guard rails.  The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.  Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.  Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.  Somebody made a lot of money on that.  They don't know what is happening.
So we have to make our country great again.  We have to rebuild our country.  And we have a long way to go.  We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.  We owe it to other countries.  They're the ones that hold the debt.  And then we give them money.  We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.  I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.  It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them.  What are we doing; why aren't they paying us?  Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing?  I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea.  You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea.  Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on?
Now, we have a very important election coming up.  We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people.  Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.  We have some good people.
It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.  He failed.  I mean I liked him.  Look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away.  The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away.  What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time.  It's not fair because it was a long t--  That doesn't work.  But more importantly, he choked.  Something happened to him in the last month.  He had that election won.  And let me tell you something.  That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal.  I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it.  Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.  And there are many of them.  Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that.  You can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.  I really do.  I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.  So you can't have Romney.  He choked.
You can't have Bush.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  You know they copied it.  I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing.  But I said it.  I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.  But he's totally in favor of Common Core.  He's very, very weak on immigration.  Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.  I say, what?  Come for love?  You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals.  They're coming for love?  They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.  And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama.  I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama.  'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.  And then he appointed Justice Roberts.  And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.  And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.  So you can't have Jeb Bush.  And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.  So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.  That's it.  That's it.  It's so simple.
So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.  And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.  And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.  He is reading it.  I mean give me a break.  Everything is read.  You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.  And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.  But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.  No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.  But we have to do something about these teleprompters.
But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.  And you'll see that.  An incredible company; a wonderful company.  I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.  And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.  We have such great potential.
So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in:
creating jobs;
defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;
reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;
stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;
saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;
repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.  And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.  And everybody can be covered.  I'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.  Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.  Nobody knows.  As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;
fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.  And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.  I just got the best hotel in North America.  I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.  I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress.  Right on Penn.--  The  Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.  Do you believe that?  And everybody wanted it.  So, I can't believe it myself.  But it's going to be fantastic;
and so many other things.
I know what needs to be done to make America great again.  We can make this country great again.  The potential is enormous.  And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job.
Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Beautiful.  Thank you.


SPEECH 2


Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.


It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.


That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.


America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.


In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.






History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.


They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.


We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.


They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.


First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.


We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.
I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one who knows how to fix it.






Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.


They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.


The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.






The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.


Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.




And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.




All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.


When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.


Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.


President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.


We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.
Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don’t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.


Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It’s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.


Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.


The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.


He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.


Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.


We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.






We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.






Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.


Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. This will all change when I become president.


To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It’s going to be a friend again. We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.






We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.




This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.






First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.


In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.


We should work — thank you.






We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It’s now two-way. And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. There’s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.


A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.


And then there’s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how. We must...






... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.


But they’re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.






Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.


And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.


We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.


But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.




This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.


This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans...






Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.






Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.


And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do it


And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.


In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.






We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.


Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.


Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.


Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.


We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be doing it.
No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.


After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.






I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.






I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.






Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.


After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.


I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.






However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.


And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.






We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.


Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.






These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. We want them to be our allies.


We want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.


To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans.






Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade.






So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.






No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.






And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.






NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I’ve just gotten to see it. I’ve toured Pennsylvania. I’ve toured New York. I’ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.


Never again, only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.


Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.






I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.


The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.






And always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must — we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.


SPEECH 3


A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They’re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, "Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means." This was not me. This was Rubio that said, "He has small hands and you know what that means." Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later ... and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "Mr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands." And then another one would say, "You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea." I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands." I had fifty people ... Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, "How are Mr. Trump’s hands?" My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, "Oh, your hands are very nice. They are normal." So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ... now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn’t work out. Obviously, it didn’t work too well. But one of the things he said was "He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else." You can look it up. I didn’t say it.


 I don’t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I’m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me ... every time I’d shake people’s hand, "Oh, you have nice hands." Why shouldn’t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions ... I even held up my hands, and said, "Look, take a look at that hand."


  I don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, ‘Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ I didn’t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the– a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can’t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I’ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it’s not a question of presidential ...


SPEECH 4


  Oh boy. We love Nevada. We love Nevada. Thank you. Thank you. Oh this is a great place. Thank you very much. Great evening. We will be celebrating for a long time tonight. Have a good time. Have a good time.
You know we weren’t expecting—a couple of months ago, we weren’t expecting to win this one, you know that, right? We weren’t. Of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren’t expected to win too much, and now we’re winning, winning, winning the country. And soon the country’s going to start winning, winning, winning. So I want to thank the volunteers. They’ve been unbelievable. These people, they work like endlessly, endlessly. We’re not going to forget it. And we’ve had some great numbers coming out of Texas, and amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia and Arkansas and then in a couple of weeks later Florida. We love Florida so. We’re going to do very well in Ohio. We’re beating the governor. It’s always nice to be beating the governor. And Michigan—the whole thing. It’s going to be an amazing two months.
We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. So tonight we had 45 to 46%, and tomorrow you’d hear them say, you know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%. So if they could—they keep forgetting that when people drop out, we’re going to get a lot of votes. You know they keep forgetting.
So I want to begin by thanking my boys, Eric has been all over the place making speeches. He’s getting better than me so I’m a little jealous. And Don went to _____, you were all over, right?
He loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA, both of them, both of them. We love the Second Amendment folks. Nobody loves it more than us, so just remember that.
And Corey and Hope, the staff, the whole group, and Charles and Dan and what a group we have. I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here, the owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, stand up. Great guy. Phil said, "Donald,"—like for the last three months he’s driving me crazy, he said—"Donald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign." I said, "Phil I don’t want your money. I don’t want to do it. I’m self funding." Every time I see him. It’s hard for me to turn down money because that’s what I’ve done in my whole life. I grab and grab and grab. You know I get greedy. I want money, money.
I’ll tell you what we’re going to do, right? We get greedy, right? Now we’re going to get greedy for the United States. We’re going to grab and grab and grab. We’re going to bring in so much money and so much everything. We’re going to make America great again, folks, I’m telling you folks, we’re going to make America great again.
And another great friend of mine, someone respected by everybody, a great friend of Phil too—Mr. and Mrs. Steve Wynn. Stand up, Steve. Stand up. Two great people. Steve is always calling. He’s always got advice, right Steve? "Donald I think you should do this and that." His advice I like to listen to, I’ll be honest. So Phil and Steve and families, we appreciate it. You’ve been great friends. Thank you, thank you.
So this was very exciting tonight. But I’ll tell you it looks like we won by a lot evangelicals. I love evangelicals, and I have to tell you pastor [Robert] Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere. He has been great. And as you know Liberty University—do we love Liberty University? Huh? Jerry Falwell Jr., an unbelievable guy, and he has been with us and with us from the beginning, and I want to thank Jerry and his family. It’s been amazing, the relationship. So we won the evangelicals.
We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We’re the smartest people, we’re the most loyal people, and you know what I’m happy about? Because I’ve been saying it for a long time. 46% were the Hispanics—46%, No. 1 one with Hispanics. I’m really happy about that.
So I’m very proud of you, this is an amazing night. I love the country, I love the country. We’re going in the wrong direction. We’re going to keep—as you know Gitmo, we’re keeping that open, and we’re going to load it up with bad dudes. We’re going to load it up w a lot of bad dudes out there. We’re going to have our borders nice and strong. We’re going to build the wall, you know that. We’re going to build the wall. And I have a lot of respect from Mexico, and you just heard we won Hispanics. But let me tell you Mexico is going to pay for the wall, right? It’s going to happen. It’s going to happen. They know it. I know it. We all know it.
We have a tremendous deficit. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. They’ll pay for the wall. They’ll be very happy about it. Believe me. I’ll talk to them. They’re going to be very, very thrilled. They’re going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall.
We’re going to be the smart people. We’re not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place. We’re going to be the smart people. You’re going to be proud of your president, and you’re going to be even prouder of your country, OK?
So tonight folks, this was a great evening. I love this place. I love this state. I love Las Vegas. I have spent and invested so much money over here. Trump International Hotel—I keep telling Steve we have the best hotel in Las Vegas. He’s fighting me all the time. But that’s OK. But I just want to say it’s a great state, and they have great people. And I was so proud. You know, I went to caucus. I was all over the place tonight. The people are amazing. The enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see.
The people of this country are absolutely amazing. I love you folks very much. Remember: Make America great again. We’re going to do it, and it’s going to happen fast. Thank you very much everybody. We love you. We love you.


SPEECH 5


Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.


So nice, thank you very much. That’s really nice. Thank you. It’s great to be at Trump Tower. It’s great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it’s an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody’s expectations. There’s been no crowd like this.


And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn’t know the air-conditioner didn’t work. They sweated like dogs.






They didn’t know the room was too big, because they didn’t have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don’t think it’s gonna happen.






Our country is in serious trouble. We don’t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don’t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.


When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn’t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.


When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically.


The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.


SPEECH 6


Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.


oh And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people.


It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.


Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They’ve become rich. I’m in competition with them.


They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don’t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should’ve taken.


So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don’t have, Iran has. And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, "Don’t hit Iraq," because you’re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they’re taking it over big league.


We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they’re great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.


And we have nothing. We can’t even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.


Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It’s never below zero.


Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.


And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don’t believe the 5.6. Don’t believe it.


That’s right. A lot of people up there can’t get jobs. They can’t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.


But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it’s a statistic that’s full of nonsense.


Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.


It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don’t know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t know what they’re doing."


We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.


Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it’s virtually useless. It’s virtually useless. It is a disaster.TRUMP: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn’t work. A $5 billion Web site.


If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.


The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn’t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.


For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.


I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site.
Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing’s gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not.


As an example, I’ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they’re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don’t know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I’m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don’t know — "Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?"


I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don’t talk jobs and they don’t talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They’re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn’t believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They’re killing us.


But you don’t hear that from anybody else. You don’t hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.
Thank you.


I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, "What’s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don’t need the rhetoric. I want a job."


And that’s what’s happening. And it’s going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in ’16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I’d say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he’d like to play, that’s fine.






In fact, I’d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.






But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who’s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It’s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now."


We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.
So I’ve watched the politicians. I’ve dealt with them all my life. If you can’t make a good deal with a politician, then there’s something wrong with you. You’re certainly not very good. And that’s what we have= representing us. They will never make America great again. They don’t even have a chance. They’re controlled fully — they’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.


Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They’re great. But you know what? it won’t happen. It won’t happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it’s destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.


We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.






And we also need a cheerleader.


You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he’ll do well. I think he’ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he’d be a great spirit."


He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.


He’s not a leader. That’s true. You’re right about that.


But he wasn’t a cheerleader. He’s actually a negative force. He’s been a negative force. He wasn’t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.


We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It’s not great again.


We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.






And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They’re saying, "Dad, you’re going to do something that’s going to be so tough."


You know, all of my life, I’ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can’t happen. And yet that’s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.


So ladies and gentlemen...






I am officially running...






... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.






It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.


We have people that aren’t working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they’re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they’ll be proud, and they’ll love it, and they’ll make much more than they would’ve ever made, and they’ll be — they’ll be doing so well, and we’re going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.






I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.






I’ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I’ll bring back our jobs, and I’ll bring back our money.


Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal’s even better.


How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?






I’m going to tell you — thank you. I’m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I’m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.


Number one, the people negotiating don’t have a clue. Our president doesn’t have a clue. He’s a bad negotiator.


He’s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.


We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That’s the negotiator we have.


Take a look at the deal he’s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won’t exist very long. It’s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...
So we need people — I’m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don’t have talented people, if you don’t have great leadership, if you don’t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.


Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren’t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it’s just not going to work.


So, here’s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.


But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. And it’s impossible for our people here to compete.


So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who’s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He’s very upset. I said, "What’s your problem?"


He said, "You know, I make great product."


And I said, "I know. I know that because I buy the product."


He said, "I can’t get it into China. They won’t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."


I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that’s terrible. Does anyone know this?"


He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."


I said, "They send it back?"


"Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They’re not supposed to be doing that. I told them."


Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.


Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing’s secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.


Hey, I’m not saying they’re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.


I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, "Oh, you don’t like China?"


No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can’t sustain ourself with that. There’s too much — it’s like — it’s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That’s the difference between China’s leaders and our leaders.


They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We’re rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they’re all over the place.


We have all the cards, but we don’t know how to use them. We don’t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don’t understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.


Now they’re going militarily. They’re building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we’d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn’t let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.


They’re building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.


And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.


So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, "That’s a terrible story. I hate to hear it."


But I have another one, Ford.


So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It’s going in and that’s going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they’re not going to Tennessee. They’re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.


Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it’s going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.


So I announced that I’m running for president. I would...






... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn’t even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.


You get a lot of them that are overrated. They’re not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they’re not good.


But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.


But I wouldn’t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I’d say, "Congratulations. I understand that you’re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."


And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right? "How does that help us? Where is that good"? It’s not.


So I would say, "Congratulations. That’s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that’s it.


Now, here’s what is going to happen. If it’s not me in the position, it’s one of these politicians that we’re running against, you know, the 400 people that we’re (inaudible). And here’s what’s going to happen. They’re not so stupid. They know it’s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they’re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can’t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can’t do that to Ford."


And guess what? No problem. They’re going to build in Mexico. They’re going to take away thousands of jobs. It’s very bad for us.


So under President Trump, here’s what would happen:






The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he’d want to be cool, and he’ll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.


And he’ll say, "Please, please, please." He’ll beg for a little while, and I’ll say, "No interest." Then he’ll call all sorts of political people, and I’ll say, "Sorry, fellas. No interest," because I don’t need anybody’s money. It’s nice. I don’t need anybody’s money.


I’m using my own money. I’m not using the lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care. I’m really rich. I (inaudible).






And by the way, I’m not even saying that in a — that’s the kind of mindset, that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country.
So — because we got to make the country rich.


It sounds crass. Somebody said, "Oh, that’s crass." It’s not crass.


We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.


We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.


We’ve got nothing. We’ve got Social Security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I’m not going to cut it at all; I’m going to bring money in, and we’re going to save it.






But here’s what’s going to happen:


After I’m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I’m called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I’ll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He’ll say. "Please reconsider," I’ll say no.


He’ll say, "Mr. President, we’ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we’re not going to build it in Mexico." That’s it. They have no choice. They have no choice.


There are hundreds of things like that. I’ll give you another example.TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say "we’re gonna protect." What are we doing? They’ve got nothing but money.


If the right person asked them, they’d pay a fortune. They wouldn’t be there except for us.


And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.


They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We’re always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.


But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They;re gone.


And I’m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I’m running against now — it’s so nice to say I’m running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I’m running.






But all of these politicians that I’m running against now, they’re trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn’t answer the question. He didn’t know. I said, "Is he intelligent?"


Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn’t know. He couldn’t answer the question.


How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can’t. They don’t have a clue. They can’t lead us. They can’t. They can’t even answer simple questions. It was terrible.


But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.


There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We’re dying. We’re dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.


So Ford will come back. They’ll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that’s based on competence.


So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you’re not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?"


I said, "I don’t know." I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I’m actually a very nice person."


But, I said, "This is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we’re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I’ll do. I’ll do it. Because a lot of people said, "He’ll never run. Number one, he won’t want to give up his lifestyle."


They’re right about that, but I’m doing it.


Number two, I’m a private company, so nobody knows what I’m worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.


So I said, "That’s OK." I’m proud of my net worth. I’ve done an amazing job.


I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.


But he used to say, "Donald, don’t go into Manhattan. That’s the big leagues. We don’t know anything about that. Don’t do it."


I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I’ve gotta do it."


And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I’m building all over the world, and I love what I’m doing.


But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he’s private and he’s probably not as successful as everybody thinks."


So I said to myself, you know, nobody’s ever going to know unless I run, because I’m really proud of my success. I really am.






I’ve employed — I’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.


So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it’s big and complex, and they’ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don’t extensions or anything. We’ll be filing it right on time. We don’t need anything.






And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion." So I said (ph), "No, that’s the wrong number. That’s the wrong number. Not assets."


So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It’s real estate. You know, it’s real estate.


It’s labor, and it’s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren’t in unions, and it’s all over the place and building all over the world.


And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.


And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That’s long-term debt, very low interest rates.


In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don’t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion"? I said, "I don’t need it. I don’t want it. And I’ve been there. I don’t want it."


But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it’ll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.


So the total is $8,737,540,00.


Now I’m not doing that...






I’m not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don’t have to brag. I don’t have to, believe it or not.


I’m doing that to say that that’s the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.


We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don’t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.


So I put together this statement, and the only reason I’m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we’re at $8 trillion now. We’re soon going to be at $20 trillion.TRUMP: According to the economists — who I’m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they’re saying — that $24 trillion — we’re very close — that’s the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That’s when we become Greece. That’s when we become a country that’s unsalvageable. And we’re gonna be there very soon. We’re gonna be there very soon.


I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.






Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.






Now, it’s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn’t want guns. And now since this happened" — it’s up in the prison area — "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We’re ready to start shooting."


I said, "Very interesting."


So protect the Second Amendment.






End — end Common Core. Common Core should — it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don’t see how he can possibly get the nomination. He’s weak on immigration. He’s in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can’t do it. We have to end — education has to be local.


Rebuild the country’s infrastructure.


Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.


I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.


You know, we’re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we’re converting it into one of the world’s great hotels. It’s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.


Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we’re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I’ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.


So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it’s like we’re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.


You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.


Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.






Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that’s being lost.


Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.


Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what’s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.


Be careful of a bubble because what you’ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.


And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.


SPEECH 7




Chris, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
This has been an amazing evening. Already, we’ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.


It’s really been — it’s really been great.
I want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas. He worked hard on he — I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win. That was an excellent win.
We’re going to make America great again, folks. We’re going to make it great again.
And, you know, I watched Hillary’s speech and she’s talking about wages have been poor and everything’s poor and everything’s doing badly, but we’re going to make it — she’s been there for so long. I mean, if she hasn’t straightened it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. It’s just going to become worse and worse. She wants to make America whole again and I’m trying to figure out what is that all about. Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.
So I just want to say that this was an exciting evening. It’s so great to be in Florida. It’s so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.


I know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio. He had a tough night but he worked hard. He spent a lot of money. He is a lightweight, as I’ve said many times before. But you know what? We’re going to go to Florida, we’re going to spend so much time in Florida. We’ve got about a 20-point lead. I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they’re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires. And frankly, I think that’s fine. As far as I’m concerned, it’s fine. And if he wins, they’ll have totally controlled — total control. But he’s not going anywhere anyway, but we’ll see what happens. But we’re going to spend a lot of time in Florida.
The Virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in Florida. Remember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-A-Lago and so many other places. And it’s been an amazing place to invest. It’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.
And you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we’ll just say all over the country. And it’s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.
Recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation. I mean, our nation is in serious trouble. We’re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed. China is just taking advantage of us. I have nothing against China. I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don’t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. It won’t be that way for long. We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we’re going to redo those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty.
You look at countries like Mexico, where they’re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border. They’re destroying us in terms of economic development. Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico. Ford, moving into Mexico. Nabisco, closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico. We have to stop it, folks. I know how to stop it. We’re going to create jobs. We’re going to create jobs like you’ve never seen.
We’re going to lower taxes. I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen. We’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class. The middle class has been forgotten in our country. It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of, but we’ve forgotten the middle class. So we’re going to lower taxes.
We’re lowering taxes on business. You look at all the companies that are moving out. When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they’re leaving. They used to move from New York to Florida, or they’d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris. But now they’re moving from here —  — not that many people are leaving New Jersey. But Chris understands the problem, fully understands. Now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world. We can’t let that happen.
We’ve lost our manufacturing jobs. We’ve lost our manufacturing. Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses. I mean, we are losing so much. We can’t let it happen.
I tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar. And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they’ve cut the yen. They’ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete. And I don’t want that to happen. That’s not going to happen. They shouldn’t be allowed to do it.
We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source. We have great, great power. The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don’t know what they’re doing. So we’re going to work very, very hard.
I’m so honored by this evening. If you would’ve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this. You have a lot of cameras here tonight.


It looked, literally, like the Academy Awards. I never saw so many cameras in my life. And it takes courage to run. I’ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president. I’ve never done this before. I’ve been a job-producer. I’ve done a lot of things but this is something I’ve never done, but I felt we had to do it. When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing. When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted. We’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.


So it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight. And if you want, press, I think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.
Yes, go ahead.


Well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.
But let me just explain something. If you’ve seen what’s happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what’s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all. I mean, right now, they’re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states. It’s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts — (CHEERS) — Tennessee, Virginia. And you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more. In fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.
But I will say this. Look, we have expanded the Republican Party. When you look at what’s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in. They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they’re Democrats and they’re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we’ve actually expanded the party. Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example. Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes. We doubled it. We were almost 800,000. Whereas the Democrats went down. There’s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats.
So I — look, I’m a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier. Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, that’s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she’s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. I don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run. And I think that’s, frankly, going to be an easy race. You see the polls. I beat Hillary in many polls. I know one thing. I don’t think Marco is going to be able to beat her. I don’t think — in all fairness, I think Ted’s going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit.
So I just tell you this. We are going to be a much finer party, a much — we’re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you. And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening. We’re going to be a much bigger party. Our party is expanding. And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I’ve won and just look — we’ve gone from X number to a much larger number. That hasn’t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we’re going to be more inclusive. I think we’re going to be more unified and I think we’re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we’re going to win in November. OK, yeah?


I’m just doing what’s right. Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some — for many, many — for millions of women. And I’ll say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that’s really — because I’m a conservative, but I’m a common-sense conservative. But millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. But we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I’ve said it loud and clear. But — and we’ll see what happens. But Planned Parenthood — millions of people — and I’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. And this wasn’t a setup. This was people writing letters. I’m going to be really good for women. I’m going to be good for women’s health issues. It’s very important to me, very important to me.
 And maybe that’s not a perfect conservative view, but I can tell you one thing. I’m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you’re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.
So Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?
Yeah, go ahead, finish it.


I feel awfully good. I mean, I’m watching your people — I’m watching your people on — and I’m going to be very nice, I’m going to be very nice — I’m watching your people on CNN and I’m watching the Fox people and I’m watching the MSNBC people, too, OK? See? I’m becoming diplomatic.  And they are certainly being very nice to me tonight. I mean, you know, they’re being very strong. And they are, they’re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true. He didn’t win anything. He hasn’t won anything, period.
And by the way, and I have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty. I’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty. He hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.
But I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas and it’s a big get. Now I also did very well in Texas. I came in second. And one of the things my son, Eric, told me, which I didn’t even realize, is that not only did I win most of the states — and some are coming in and I’m expected to win them — but I came in second — I came in no worse than second. So it wasn’t like I won and then I disappeared. The worst I had was a second. So I’m very, very honored by the turnout, OK?
Yes, go ahead.


Right. Oh, they’re totally wrong. Look, I disavowed. I disavowed when I — in fact, Chris is my number one — Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign. He called me. He said, "Donald, what you’ve got is a movement." We spoke today in Kentucky. You’ve never seen a crowd like that. That had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible. And every place we’re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group. We had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama. And when Chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like I’ve never seen. And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. They’ve never seen what’s happening right now. They’ve never seen anything like it. And I’m just honored by it.
Now, when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question. I said I disavow. Now, right after the program that we’re talking about — and I thought it was clear, but you know, we’re talking about groups, groups, groups. I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the group. But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow. Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that. It was right after. And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again. I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? But I disavow and hopefully it’s the final time I have to do it. But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.
Yes, go ahead.


No, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation. It’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully I will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the American people.
So you know, look, you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he’s done executive order, executive order. It’s almost like, I don’t even know. Does he ever go a deal with Congress anymore? Does he ever speak to the Senate? Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?
You know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that I — is very, very important to me; corporate inversion. Carl Icahn, who’s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he — it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we’re losing companies. And we’re losing for two reasons. We’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high. We have the highest — we’re the highest taxed nation in the world.
And very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country. The Democrats agree it should be brought back in. The Republicans agree it should be brought back in. Everybody agrees it should be brought back in. I could sit in a room — or the Oval Office — for a period of, literally, a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody — every single — you know, it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight. Here’s something every single — I mean, almost everybody agrees. These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.
The president can’t make a deal. The reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal, probably doesn’t work at it, probably doesn’t care, but you’re talking about tremendous number of — tremendous amounts of money. So when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal, there’s something going on that’s really wrong. And what it means is you have the wrong leader.
Yes?


Well, look, everything — we are going to have a wall. I can tell you we are going to have a wall. I watched the ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man. And I get along great with Hispanics. You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll, the Hispanic vote. I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic. I’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime. These are great people. The Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it. Vincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have — if I ever used that word you folks would’ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it. Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word. But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year — $58 billion. The wall is going to cost $10 billion. It’s so easy. I’ve had these guys that I’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall. One — as sure as you’re standing there, 100 percent, Mexico’s going to pay, 100 percent.


And the reason is I’m a businessman. I know how to do this. Politicians are all talk, no action. It’s not going to — except for Chris Christie, of course.  It’s not — look, it’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen with these people.
So when you think of it — and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall. Well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere. I buy a lot of equipment from John Deere. I love John Deere, too. But they didn’t have tractors. They didn’t have cranes. They didn’t have excavation equipment. The wall is 13,000 miles long. We need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials. We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall.
We’re going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire. You know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me. And when you go, you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so bucolic, so beautiful. You look at the fields and you look at everything, it’s so beautiful. And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine. The heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted. And I told them I’m going to stop it. I’m going to stop it. We’re going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.
And by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country, but they’re going to come in legally, OK?


I’ve got to find out what’s going on. We’ve got a big problem. We have a big, big problem. I’ll tell it like it is. We have a big, big problem. We’ve got to figure it out. We’re going to figure it out. Radical Islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us. You take a look at Germany, you take a look at Sweden, you take a look at Brussels. You look at some of these places, it’s like a disaster. And we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they’re young and they’re strong. You look at that migration line; they’re young, they’re strong, they’re powerful. And you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country?
Now, with all of that being said, I feel strongly — I have a bigger heart than anybody. We’re going to build a safe zone. It’s going to be in Syria. And I’m going to get the Gulf states, who have more money than anybody — we’ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit. We’re going to get — but they’re not accepting people. We’re going to get — wait, wait, wait. We’re going to get the Gulf states to pay for it because they should.


Oh, we’re going to bring them back. We’re going to bring them back. Look, I’m telling you — you know how I’m going to bring them back? First of all, we’re going to do great with the African- Americans, and you see that in the polls where I had in one poll where I’m 25 percent. And one of the commentators, who I think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if Donald Trump gets 25 percent of the African-American vote, this election is over. You watch. And the reason I’m getting that — and I’m going to do great with the Hispanics. I’m going to do great with virtually every group. The reason is I’m going to bring jobs back. I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China. How does it help us when they make it in China?


Well, look, I always liked Marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile. He decided to become Don Rickles, OK? But Don Rickles has a lot more talent. Honestly, I did, I always liked him but he became — you know, somebody told him you’re losing very badly. The only way you can possibly win, take the hail Mary, they called it a hail Mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile. It’s hurt him. In fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent. It’s really hurt him.
But look, I’m not going to tell him what to do. I’m not going to tell anybody what to do. You have to run. He had a bad night, according to CNN, Fox. I watched their broadcasts. They say the loser of the night was Marco Rubio and it’s true. He didn’t win anything. He hasn’t won. I mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something, and you know, Marco has not won. You’ve got to be able to win. You can’t talk. You know, these politicians, all talk, no action. You’ve got to be able to win something. He hasn’t won anything. And he actually hasn’t come very close. So we’ll see what happens.
Yes, go ahead.


I’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble. Our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports. I go throughout the world. I mean, you go to Qatar, you go to — some people say Qatar, but you go to Qatar, you go to any of — so many places. You go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have. You look at the roadways they have. You look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have. We’re like a third world country.
So I am going to be very good for the world. I’m going to get along with the world. You’re going to be very proud of me. Even you will be very proud of me as a president. But we have to rebuild our country. Our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that.
And Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue. She can’t do that. She’s talking about — I mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, I think one of the reasons I have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today — less money than they made 12 years ago. And in her speech, she just said they’re making less money. Well, she’s been there with Obama for a long period of time. Why hasn’t she done anything about it? Practically everything that she was complaining about — she’s picked up what I say. The difference is she’s been there for a long period of time. Why haven’t they done anything about it?
Then you look at her record as secretary of State. It’s abysmal. You look at what’s going on with Syria. You look at what’s going on with everything. It’s a disaster.
So we’re going to have an interesting period of time. I don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run. What she did is a criminal act. If she’s allowed to run I would be very, very surprised. But if she’s allowed to run, honestly, it’ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. And what she did — (CHEERS) — let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.
OK, one or two more questions. Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy


At this moment, absolutely not, no. We either have a country or we don’t. We have a country, or we don’t. We have borders or we don’t have borders. And at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.


Well, look, I don’t expect — I have a lot of respect for Reince and for the group and I like the RNC and I don’t know that I’ve been treated fairly or not. I really don’t know. I can’t tell you that. But I can tell you that I do respect them.
What I really have is a great number of people. I have millions and millions of people. And when I was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers. The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don’t. They don’t have any energy. Their numbers are down. Our number are through the roof. And people are making the statements they’ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.
I think if somebody is doing as well as I’m doing — and I’m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else — but if I’m going to win five — I’ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine. It could be nine, could win nine states tonight. If I’m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if I’m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we’re a democracy. I think it’s awfully hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party, right? You know, it’s very hard.
But I really think that — I think it’s a great question, David, because I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the Republican Party has become more dynamic. It’s become more diverse. We’re taking from the Democrats. We’re taking from the independents. We have a lot more people. We have a lot more people. I mean, take a look at South Carolina. Look at the numbers. Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote. And then you look at — I was there and you had lines that went a mile long. And it was virtually more than doubled.
So we have a very, very dynamic party and I think we’re going to be able to unify the party. I hope to be able to get along with everybody. I don’t know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him. I do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him. But remember this. I have millions and millions and millions of people. This isn’t like it’s a close match. I mean, it’s only too bad that winner didn’t take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over. We’re just having a celebration.


You know, we’re having a celebration.
So anyway, I would like to — look, I just want to end by thanking everybody. This has been an amazing period in my life. My wife just called and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she’s a special person and it’s going to be great and we look forward to that. She’s back in New York. She wanted to be here. They all wanted to be here but they’re with Ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week. But this this has been an amazing period of time. It’s been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint. And I think, honestly, we’ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and I’m very proud of it.
And I just want to leave you with this. I am a unifier. I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify. And when we unify, there’s nobody, nobody that’s going to beat us.
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.


Thank you very much. Thank you.


SPEECH 8


This is so — so incredible. —


 We — we have had, no matter where we go — you know, it’s a movement, folks. This is a movement.






No matter where we go, it’s amazing. We go to Dallas. We go to Oklahoma. We go all over. We went to, the other night, Iowa — packed. Every place — New Hampshire, packed. Every place we go to, it’s like this. It’s amazing. And just great, great people.






And they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, "go home." We’ll come back. We’ll do another one. But they had to go home. Would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in? No?


I don’t think so, but we — they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually. So maybe next time. I don’t know. I think this is the largest room. I know it’s a record for the room.






You know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they’re standing. They’re not sitting. So that’s great. I love — we love setting records. We want the country to set records, right?






So, you know, I — I do this, and I love to do it. And I talk about our success because that’s ultimately what it’s all about. I think we’re going to do fantastically well in Iowa. I really think we’re going to do great there. And I could say, "Oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five." I’m not — I’m looking to win everything. We want to run the table. We want to run it, because that sends a signal.


And, you know, we’ve been a little bit — we had to respond to Hillary. She came out with that — she came out — remember, she wrote — she said, "He’s got a — he’s demonstrated a penchant" — I demonstrated — "a penchant for sexism." Can you believe it? Me? Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you.






And, you know, when she said that, I had no choice, because I didn’t start it. I had no choice. And I did have to mention her husband’s situation. OK?


(Laughter)


And that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. So, we have to do it. You can’t let people push you around. You can’t let people tell lies. You can’t do it.


 You know, it’s interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it’s Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that. I can see it.






And they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote — they never vote, they don’t care — they’re going to mostly — I’ll tell you what, they’re going to vote for Trump. That’s why they’re coming in, because they’re so fed up with the system — this corrupt, horrible system. They’re fed up with it and they’re fed up with those guys back there, the media.


TRUMP: They are the worst.






No, no, no. They’re fed up. They’re fed up with the media. I mean, I’ve got — and you know, not all bad, but there’s so much dishonesty in the media. And I like to call it out. And one of the things that’s really been amazing to me, and such — it’s been so beautiful to watch — the level of genius in the public. They get it, you know? They really get it. They want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, "Oh, gee."


The level of genius — they fully understand. They know they’re crooked, they know they’re dishonest and they really — otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?


(Laughter)


And yet, I see a poll at 42 percent. And you know, you’re talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17. How are you? Started with 17 people. And you know, I’d be happy with 42 if we had three, OK? Not thrilled, I’d like to be that — over that 50 mark, but I think we’re doing really well.


And you know, it’s interesting, but the debates — OK. So the debates — thank — I love you too, darling.


(Laughter)


I love you. I do. I love you. I love every — you know what? The rooms, no matter where, whether it’s stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, it’s amazing, and there’s love in the room. And I told — the other night, I said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China. That’s what we need, not these hacks that we have.






No, no. I have guys ...






Carl Icahn endorsed me. Great business man. We have — I have great, great business people that want to be involved. And we’re going to use — we have the best. We have the best in the world. We don’t use them. We use political hacks, we use special interest people that really don’t care about the country, they care about their deals.


This is going to change so fast. You know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with China. Think about it. You know what $500 billion is? You do — you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit — trade deficit with China. What are we? Are we — yes, I guess the answer is certainly let’s not blame us.


Our leaders are stupid and — and/or — you have to say and/or they have deals, because what’s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do — our leaders, can you believe our leaders? This is what — but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don’t even want to do because they’ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.


I look at this guy Jeb Bush. He spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave. He is nowhere. No, no. Think of it. It’s got to be much more than that. It was actually $59 million a while ago. Every time I turn on an add, I see an ad about Trump. I mean, it’s not that bad an ad either. It’s like — you know.






If you’re going to do an ad, do an ad. But he’s a low-energy person. Let’s face it. We don’t need low-energy. We need lots of energy.






But he spent — think of it. Think of it. He spent $59 million. I spent nothing, right? Nothing.






Now, I’m going to be spending. You probably saw I’m going to spend — now, we’re going to start spending a lot of money because I don’t want to take any chances. You know, it’s — I love getting up — and for the last couple of months, I have been leading from practically the time I announced, right? And for the last — and leading a lot. I’m going to go over that because I go over (ph) polls. I love polls. I love polls.






Now, when they — if they turn negative, I don’t like them.






And I promise, if they turn negative, I’m not going to be talking about them. In fact, I get criticized all the time. You’re always talking about your polls. One of these guys just got two. He’s at two. I’m at 42. And one of these guys who’s at two said, "He always talks about his polls and I don’t." I wouldn’t either if I had two, I swear I wouldn’t.






I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t do it at all. But you know, I love to tell the story where I have spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that. That’s just — you know, because I see since then — I mean, just — you can’t turn on this television without these commercials. And Fox — every two minutes it’s a commercial on Trump.


You know what he did? It’s false advertising. So I killed him in the debate. According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who’s an amazing guy, by the way. If you don’t know Drudge — Matt Drudge. Right? He’s a great guy. But Drudge, 46 percent. At 46 percent, you have 15 people. Now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out. A couple or more.


But 15, 16 people — 46 percent. Time magazine, 49 percent. Think of it. Slate, 51 percent. U.S. News and World Report — 69 percent said I won the debate. I wont the debate, right?






PBS, Public Broadcasting System — 69 percent said Trump won.






No, you know, it is amazing. We have Washington Times at 62 percent. CBS, 59 percent. Fox, 62 percent — Fox Las Vegas, 62 percent. So, they all say — then they go back home, after the debate. I like to see how did I do? Did I look good? Looking good is very important, right? Sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it’s how did you look?


Oh, I looked good, didn’t sound too good, but that is OK. You wonder if that is a good trait. But I go home, and I watch, and the pundits will say — and they can’t totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what’s happening — well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight. He was — I won every single online poll, I won.


And then, here’s Bush. So, Bush does an ad. And he takes me — and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage — and then I killed him. I mean, he — by the way, I met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got. He came in last.






He takes the ad — and I shouldn’t even talk about him. He’s down to two or three — I — but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? I say, why is he doing this? Doesn’t he have something better, he should go home.






Just relax. You know, honestly, he should go home and relax. He shouldn’t be wasting his time. But it does. I say, why is this guy spending all this money? Now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere — but here is my ad. So, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great. He took on Trump, he took on Trump. I’m standing here, he’s over here. Took on Trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster. You know? So, he would remember (ph) it.


He said, "Mr. Trump, why don’t you this?" I said, OK. Then I gave him an answer. I said, "Jeb, I’m at 42, you are at 2. Right? It is a simple answer. You started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage. Right?






No, no, it’s true. And then — and then — and that was it. And so I responded. So, he asked me a question, question was fine. You know, professionally written. So, he asked me a question, good. I give him an answer, I blow him away. Right. Everyone says Trump won the debate. Everybody. And hat is it. So, the ad is him asking the question and I’m standing there like this, because I haven’t — in fact, you see in one of them, I’m just about ready to open my mouth.


But he doesn’t let me respond. That is almost false advertising, isn’t it? You know? So, I mentioned it, Hillary is a disaster. I mean, Hillary.


Hillary is controlled by her money. So is Jeb. So is — by the way, I’m the only one self-funding my campaign. I’m self-funding.






You know, one of the things that makes me happy. I heard one of my commentators this morning, said, "you know, I’ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and I’ve never seen anything like what has happened with Trump. One of them actually said — one of them — I’m special. You’re special. I like you. I’m special.


Isn’t that nice? That’s a very — every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you. Where are you? Who said that? Wow. So nice. Thank you. That is a nice one. That’s like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal. I think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?


Low-energy can be applied to Hillary. I just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. Right? Because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Don’t we view this as war? It’s war.


It’s war. And so, you don’t like to use it. I hate to give it up. What?


 How are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?  Oh, we are going to help your daughter. We are going to help the country, that’s called helping the daughter. We are going to help your country. So, here is the story. So, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember. And I think he went back tot he beginning, but let’s say second World War. OK? That’s enough.


And we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us. She has done a terrible job as secretary of State. Think of it. Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack. OK, that’s nice.


 And she and my opponents — oh, isn’t it terrible that Putin said — wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world? Wouldn’t it be? Seriously. No, no, wouldn’t it be nice?






I mean, they want me to refute his statement. How dare you say I’m brilliant? How dare — that’s — who’s going to do that? And by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.


But the point is, we have to get along. The world has blown up around Barack Obama.


Now, I don’t know if you saw his recent release. They were talking about the Department of State, State Department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they’ve done. Well, they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good? And they said bringing peace to Syria. Did you see that?


So instead of saying they made a mistake — call it a typo, they made a mistake — they’re trying to justify it. Well, we meant we’re working on it. Can you believe — bringing peace to Syria. The world is blowing up, the migration in Syria — they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria, and the whole world’s talking about it. It’s — the level of stupidity is incredible. I’m telling you. I used to use the word incompetent, now I just call them stupid.






I went to an Ivy League school, I’m very highly educated. I know words, I had the best words. I have — but there’s no better word than stupid.






Right? There is none. There is none.






There’s no — there’s no — there’s no word like that. So we are going to turn things around. But — and if we have Hillary — I’ve got to tell you. I just saw where for the last week she’s been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK? Really hard. And I had to say OK, that’s enough, that’s enough. And we did a strong number. She’s not going to win. Any by the way, I love the concept — I love, love, love having a woman president. Can’t be her. She’s horrible. She’s horrible.




 And you know really don’t — I’ll tell you who does not like — yeah, we’ll get Ivanka. Good. Let’s do Ivanka.






But I’ll tell you who doesn’t like Hillary are women. Women don’t like Hillary.






I see it all the time. And always so theatrical; Mr. Trump said this and that and this. And you just — I actually — I shouldn’t do it. I just have to turn off the television so many times. She just gives me a headache.






But you know — although I think last night I gave her a big headache.






I can imagine — I can imagine those discussions. But you have to hit back hard, and you can’t let them push you around. And today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name. You know, in the debate I was mentioned nine times, I mean everything. All of them. But her. I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned. And then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense. And — but she’s playing that card. And then I had to hit her back, so I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse — no, it’s tremendous abuse.


I mean, you look at it, it’s tremendous abuse. And I talked about that. And now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn’t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else. I wonder why — I wonder why.






And remember this; it’s really important. A poll just came out where we’re tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, Fox, where I’m leading by four or five points against her individually. We’re doing great. I haven’t even focused on her yet.


Look at the people I’ve focused on. I don’t want to really knock them, I don’t want to mention their names. But, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me. Wouldn’t it be nice if our country could have that same thing? You attack and they’re, boom, gone. And if we could do it verbally —






— you know, if we could do it verbally that’s even better, right? You know, who wants to use our military? By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever. Ever. Ever.






And we’re going to take care of our vets, we’re going to take care of our vets —






 And it will cost you much less money, and it will be great. I mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, You know that. And you are paying for it. And you will never ever use them. So we will get that straightened out. We are going to straighten a lot of things. We are going to straighten out Common Core. Common Core is dead. It’s going to be dead.






 When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children. They want that — they want education. They love — they don’t care about money, they don’t care about anything. They love their children and it’s local.


And they get together and they do wonderful programs. They are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in Washington. I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it. So, Obamacare, dead. Common core, gone. We are going to get rid of it. Department of Education, we are going to get rid of it.






 We are bringing education to a local level. One thing on education. So, in the world, we are ranked number 28. There are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things. And yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far — there is nobody close. Number two isn’t even close.


So we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially. I mean, it’s — can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1? And that’s what I do like saying about my campaign, I spent less money than anybody else and I have the best results.


I’m number one by a lot and I spent no money. I mean, my plane cost me some money, but I spent no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa. But I didn’t do that — I took — I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. But I spent essentially no money.


And then you have all these other guys spending vast — and they like the way the United States is run. Now, why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others. It’s not only Jeb Bush. They spend money. I see Rubio on the ads all day long.


You know, the black background. He’s got like a black thing. He should have put something like that behind him, right? Right there, the flag.






 No, no. And I like him. I think he is a nice guy. But I see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber. It’s not — I don’t think it’s good. So, think of it. I spent no money and I’m number one. Others spent — they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race. That’s what we need for our country. What? OK. I’ve got 15,000, I don’t know what the hell he means by that but that’s OK. So, but I think he’s a fan. I don’t think he’s a — are you a protester? No. OK. No body likes Trump. OK. He’s not a protester. I love you.






 You know, the only time — don’t worry about it. The only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester. Cause I always have — like, look at this room, packed. I always have the biggest crowds.


And I go home and my wife said were there many people? I watched you on television tonight. I said, I had 20,000 people. She said, they didn’t show it. They have it right on your face. So I have 20,000 people. I have 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama. Nobody knows. Because those cameras stay right in your face and I think they can’t move.


You know, I think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe — except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it’s like. They don’t even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.


And I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are. So, you know. Some time I think I’m going to put in some false protesters. I’ll put in some friendly protesters. It’s the only way I’m going to be able to get the crowd in.


So when we started, I talked about trade. I talked about the border. I talked about a lot of things. And I started on June 16th and — in Trump Tower, the famous escalator ride. And it takes guts to run for president. I’ll tell you, you know, it’s like, I’ve never did this before.


And, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate. We have the largest audience in the history of cable television. Then CNN a couple of weeks later had 23 million. Fox had 24 million. CNN had 23 million — the largest audience in the history of CNN.


Now, they’re there — the cameras are on live right now. I mean, you know. So, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible).


Now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted — they didn’t want the debates. I think they were forced to take them for licensing. Nobody wanted the debates. They drew nothing, but now they’re drawing 24 million. Now they want to have more debates — "Oh, can we have more? Can we have more?" Can they go three hours?


Do you remember when they had the one go three hours? I said, no, I’m not doing three hours. It’s too long. Who wants — I could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?


"Mr. Trump, you have 30 seconds. What would you do about ISIS?" Oh, great. And by the way, that question — I hate those questions. You know why? Because I want to be unpredictable. I don’t want to tell ISIS what I’m going to do to knock the hell out of them.






Remember, I said very strongly — (inaudible) the oil for what, four years? You’ve been watching. I mean, four years. I’ve been "get the oil, get the oil, get the oil." Because who’s going to get the oil? Iran is taking over Iraq. We made a deal for Iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side. We gave them everything. They — we don’t even get our prisoners back.


And now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them. Can you believe it? I go crazy. We would have gotten them back. All you had to do was say, "We want our prisoners back." They would have said no. I would have said, "I want them back; you don’t understand me. I want them back." They would have said, "No, we won’t do that." I would have said, "Bye-bye," and I would have left. Then I would have doubled up the sanctions. And I guarantee you...






... I guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they’ll say, "You’ve got your prisoners; can we talk?"


And I would have never given them $150 billion. I would have never given them the money. I would have never give — they’re using it — they don’t have to make nuclear. They can buy it. Why are they going to make it? Then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections. How about the area — you know, the big area? They don’t want us there. Oh, I wonder why. They don’t want us there. So they self-inspect, OK?


Then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty. "We think you’re making nuclear weapons here." "Well, let us go check, Mr. President, we’ll check."






"No, sir, we’re not making nuclear weapons. Nobody — no, we’re not; we would never do a thing like that."


These are people that have deceived us. They’ve lied to us. They’re a terrorist state. But — and I used to say it’s the worst deal that I’ve ever seen negotiated. And by the way, just to finish prisoners. So they’d come back; we get our prisoners. But then when I hear the other day that now this deal is done. It’s all done. And now I hear they want to negotiate to get — and what do they say? They said very strongly, they said, "We are going to want a lot for the prisoners. That’s out — we’re starting off; we’re going to want a lot."


Now, we’ve already taken off the sanctions. They’re already rich as hell. What — what’s going on there? That’s why I say, I mean, some people say it’s worst than stupidity. There’s something going on that we don’t know about. I mean, honest. And you almost think — I’m not saying that, and I’m not a conspiracy person. As you said, "We are; we’re saying it."






Half the people in this room are saying it. I’m trying to be — you know, I’m just hoping they’re just stupid people, OK?






Which they are. Or there’s something going on. Because it’s — it’s inconceivable. You know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be — that nobody can do what they did, right? Nobody.


So, Iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible). In other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again. And they want a lot. "We want a lot." And I just — I want to just shoot the television, you know? Because they would have had it just by saying.


And, you know, when they asked Kerry and Obama, the deal was made. Everybody knows it’s a horrible deal. It’s going to need to — it’s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they’re so rich now. You know, they became — $150 billion — they became so rich. And many other things that you don’t even know about. Most people don’t even know what the agreement says.


 But I’ll tell you what, when you look at what we’re doing, we’re not going to have — if we keep going like this, folks, we’re not going to have a country left. We’re not going to have a country. We’re not going to have a country.


And we’re like a dumping ground for the world. We’re a dumping ground. They want to take these migrants — the migrants, you know, and I feel terrible about the migration, caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. They’re the ones that caused it. They go into Libya. They knocked the hell out of Gadhafi. OK, so Gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.


You know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the Libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom. And then gets killed by the same people. So, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gadhafi.


Look at what we did in Iraq. Look at what we did in Iraq. I mean, what the hell did we get? We spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago. I keep saying two or three, it’s a lot more than that. We spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and I’m not even talking other side.


You are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. You have thousands of deaths. We have wounded warriors, who I love, all of. These guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people.






 You know, these are the greatest people. And then what happens? We leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving. So, I said, man, if I’m the enemy, I’m just going to go wait for 18 months right?


He gave a date. We are leaving Iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time. I said, I’m just sitting there watching and I’m saying, man, that’s really stupid. Because, believe me, the enemy doesn’t want to be killed. You know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?


They don’t. They want to live. And they want to take care of their families, always their families. You remember that, because their families know what’s going on OK? You think their wives don’t know what they are planning? You think their kids don’t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the World Trade Center? You think they don’t know? They know exactly what’s going on. Remember that. And frankly, I think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives, OK. But they still want to live. So here is Obama, gives an exact date. He gives an exact date and so they pull back.


And everyone says, oh, we are doing so well. Look, we’re doing so well. Why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil. I said take the oil. Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.


Because you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they fight, they’re always fighting for decades and decades, for generations. They fight, that’s what they do. They fight. How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe. They fight and they were equal militarily. They go this way, 10 feet. They go this way, 10 feet. Then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again.


Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas. Everyone goes crazy. Oh, it’s because (ph) of gas. They go back and forth. It’s the same. And they were stabilized. And I said, if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East. That’s what going to happen. You’re going to destabilize the Middle East. And that’s exactly what happened. We totally destabilized the Middle East.


We have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards. You know Iraq was horrible. It was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in. But we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out. And we shouldn’t have given dates. I mean, I would have probably said we are going to stay forever. And they would have said, oh, man.


And then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy. I mean, he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal. But when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back. And then as soon as we left, they come in OK?


So they have the oil. You know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right? China. Always China. I love China. I love Mexico. Their leaders are too smart for us. We have no border. We will build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall by the way.






 We’re building a wall, we are going to have a border. And people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process. They’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.


They are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process. So, with Iraq, so we give them the date and they take over. We didn’t take the year. So for four years, I have been talking about it. Then because of Paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.


But I didn’t want to just bomb the oil. I wanted to take oil. They’re bombing. You know, we are bombing. Great. What’s going to happen after that? So we’re bombing. And, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.


 I said, how could they keep selling it? Obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere. No, this is serious. Now think of it. He talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old Air Force one, an old Boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.


So, he’s got a problem with the carbon footprint. You can’t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone. I’m trying to figure out. Let’s see, I’m in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I can —










— right? Right? But I hear where they don’t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing —






— and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you — it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my God, I’ve got to take a shower again. My hair’s all screwed up, right?






I want to use hair spray. They say don’t use hair spray, it’s bad for the ozone. So I’m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit — you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right?






But it’s sealed, it’s beautiful. I don’t think anything gets out. And I’m not supposed to be using hair spray. But think of it. So Obama’s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you’re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia’s a problem, China’s a problem. We’ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That’s a problem.


We’ve got a lot of problems. We’ve got a lot of problems. That’s right, we don’t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don’t win anymore. We’re going to win a lot — if I get elected, we’re going to win a lot.






We’re going to win so much — we’re going to win a lot. We’re going to win a lot. We’re going to win so much you’re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You’re going to say oh no, not again. I’m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never.






But think of it. So Obama’s talking about all of this with the global warming and the — a lot of it’s a hoax, it’s a hoax. I mean, it’s a money-making industry, OK? It’s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That’s my global — I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don’t have to destroy our businesses, we don’t have to destroy our —


And by the way, China isn’t abiding by anything. They’re buying all of our coal; we can’t use coal anymore essentially. They’re buying our coal and they’re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it’s so big out there — we’re here, they’re there, it’s like they’re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe. Miss Universe, by the way, I made a great deal when I sold — oh did I get rich.






That was a great deal. You know, they broke my choppers on that. They said he talks about illegal immigration, we’re not going to put him on television. First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldn’t believe it. And NBC, I made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than I would have ever gotten — I mean, I made an unbelievable deal — far more than I ever would have gotten if I said I think I’m going to sell it if times were normal, right? Isn’t it amazing the way that stuff can work out?


But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe. But think of it. So China is spewing up all this stuff and we’re holding back. And with China — you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years. I don’t think they’re going to be doing it.


It’s like Japan. If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn’t have to help us. Somehow, that doesn’t sound so fair. Does that sound good?




 So South Korea — I order televisions, I order thousands of televisions a year. I order televisions because I have a lot of stuff and I like nice brand new — they’re all made in South Korea, most — other than Sony, and Sony, in all fairness, has lost its way. But a lot of them — Samsung, all of them. I mean, they’re all pretty much — all of them, right? I think just about. But I order thousands of televisions, they’re all from South Korea. So we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea, we get nothing. What do — we get nothing. They’re making a fortune. It’s an economic behemoth.


A lot of you don’t know we protect Germany. Germany! Mercedes Benz, how many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany. It’s an economic behemoth.


We protect Saudi Arabia. They were, during the good oil days — now it’s probably half, which is fine. But during the good old — they were making a billion — listen to this — a billion dollars a day, and we protect them. Our military — they pay us peanuts, like nothing. And then if we want to buy — we want to move to another location, well, that’s very expensive if we do that. We want — they charge us rent?


I mean, look. We are run by people that are so bad, they’re so out of their league — and I see it, I see it on the stage. You know, they’re — a lot of them are nice people. You know, a lot of people think I don’t like these people. I do like them. But they don’t have business sense, they don’t have business ability, they don’t have common sense. They’re politicians, they’re all talk, they’re no action.


When I say...






... folks, when I say, "We’re going to build a wall." Most of them say, "You can’t build a wall — build a wall." In China 2,000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we’re thinking about, OK? The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across. We have 1,000 miles.


So, China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles. We have modern cranes. We have Caterpillar tractors — I want to use Caterpillar; I don’t want to use Komatsu.






Made in America.






Even my hats, they’re made in America. It wasn’t easy to find a guy that could do those hats. You know what I’m talking about. I see so many knock-offs of my hat, right? "Make America Great Again." I see these things that are out of plastic. They’re out of all sorts of crap. Mine are made in America. And honestly, they do a great job, but they don’t produce as many as I’d like because, frankly, there’s a big — I mean, it’s amazing. Those hats are amazing. But I wanted to have it made. And you know why I wanted it — I wanted it, anyway, but I also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things — we have a website — as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling. And it’s true. First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times. "Mr. Trump, where are those hats made?" I said, "America."






I knew it. I knew it. Because as you know, if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble. But they’re being knocked off all over the world. I mean, I see hats — they’re like helmets. I see them all. But what are you going to do?


But here’s the story. We’ve got to build a wall. So when I talk and when I’m up on the stage with these guys, these people — wonderful people — and a very nice woman, Carly. She’s a nice woman. When I’m up on the stage with them, they think I’m crazy when I say "Mexico" — I’m saying, "We’re going to build a wall; it’s going to be a great wall; it’s going to be real wall. See this ceiling? This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I’m talking about."


I’m talking about a van to get up there. They’re not coming down because it’s too dangerous.






All right? Did you ever see what they do now? We have these little walls. They build ramps. They build a ramp. I say, "Wouldn’t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just..." And then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs. Do you see this? They build ramps. There was a picture in Time magazine. It’s a ramp — a little ramp that goes over the wall. So, they have a jeep — over, down, bump, make money. We get the drugs. Think of it. We — "build a wall" is right. You’ve got to build a wall.


We get the drugs. They get the cash. No so good, right? We don’t like that deal. Our politicians don’t know — they don’t know.


So when I say "Mexico’s going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, they’re not business people. They don’t understand. Mexico makes a fortune off the United States. Number one, we give them a lot of money. But in addition to that, they’re taking our businesses. They’re making — you talk about a trade deficit. I’ll tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new China. Mexico is making an absolute fortune — peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.


Let’s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. That’s a good — I can do great job at $10 billion. I think we’ll have a lot of money left over. Somebody else would — and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall. People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall. You know one of the reasons they didn’t build the wall? Because of the Environmental Protection Agency, they couldn’t get an environmental impact study approved. Can you believe it? Because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.


Now, think of it. In China, in the South China Sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top. China sends in massive excavators and they’re (inaudible). They’re building military fortresses in the South China Sea. And a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in China — he’s a great guy. They’re great people. They’re fine. They’re just too smart. I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.


They won’t be too smart when I put my people there.






When they call up, "We’d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it." "No, no. The donor now is Carl Icahn. You’re going to speak to Carl Icahn." You know Carl — great businessman. You have so many people — they call all these business people — call. So, a friend of mine, so I call him, I say, "You’re actually doing that." And then jokingly, I said, "How long did it take to get started? Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?"


He looked at me, goes, "I — I hope you’re kidding when you say that.


They conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, OK? There is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail. You’re going to hurt this. You are going to — they are doing a big thing.


They excavated — massive, massive — take a look, massive. The biggest excavation. They are ripping the hell out of that ocean. They are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it — and they’re building air fields and they’re building forts.


We couldn’t do it because, just like I said for the law. Legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement. Now, that’s probably not the only reason it didn’t happen. I heard their costs were too high. With me, that’s easy.


You know, I’m doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph). I’m under budget, I’m ahead of schedule. Hey, look at the campaign. The guy’s at $59 million and he’s down at the bottom. I’m nothing and I’m at the top. It’s the same thing.






 I actually said — it’s funny. The other day I got this great review. They said trump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem. And I’m reading, and I want to see. The problem is, he speaks through the Applause. In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking you finish your Applause. And you know why? Because I’m so excited, because we have so much potential. It’s true.


 I don’t want to wait for your freaking Applause. We have — I have so many — we have so much potential. There are so many things to do. I don’t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it. And I just noticed, I did it again. You were getting ready to give a big Applause, because you like that, and I’m speaking. I killed the Applause. But he is right. But except, I’m not a speaker. What I am is a doer. I get things done.






 So, when the people up on the stage with me — and Hillary, Hillary doesn’t have a clue. By the way, you talk about low energy. She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe. She does. And I’ll tell you and I’ve been saying it. And maybe it’s rude, maybe it is not. But it doesn’t matter. We have a much bigger problem. We have to save our country.


So, if I’m rude and if people think I’m rude — I’m actually a nice person. I have a big heart. I want to help people. I want to help the migration. I want to do a safe zone in Syria. I don’t want them coming here. We don’t know who these people are. They are undocumented.






 And we should do a safe zone over there. We should have the Gulf states — Saudi Arabia and these states they are not spending. They have got to spend. They have to pay. You know, we are protecting them. We’re doing — they wouldn’t be there for two minutes if we weren’t protecting them. They have to start paying. They are not taking anybody, OK?


How about Germany taking millions of migrants. Can you believe what she is doing to that country? And she was the person of the year and I wasn’t. Everybody said Trump was supposed to.


(BOOING)


Hey, what are you going to do. I think she has made a terrible mistake. We will find out. Time will tell. They have tremendous crime problems. I think she has made a tremendous mistake. But what I like is in Syria, with other people’s money, meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others.


Because, look, Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They’ll give us the money. We do a massive safe zone. And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I will probably be able to get it straightened out, I understand this now.


But once it’s straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area. It is interesting, I have thousands of people that work for me. Thousands. And I have people that come from far — they are all here legally, don’t worry about it. I use E- verify. But I have people — oh, they go and check. These guys go check.


They went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally? They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds. I don’t believe it. But, you know, it is possible somebody slipped — hey, we do have 11 million people in the country. And it is probably a much higher number than that, OK? It is probably a much higher number.


But we have to do something about it and we are going to. So, I just want to finish by saying this. Look, we have a situation that is out of control. Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are laughed at by the rest of the world.


And when I started this journey, and it is a journey, and I do love you people. You’re amazing people. And by the way, you are so smart. A lot of times, they will say, well Mr. Trump’s people are blue-collar. I love blue-collar. I’m honored by that.


But they are not blue-collar. We have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people. They say the audience is old. It’s not older. The audience is young. The other night in Iowa, I told that, and I said, we have so many young people and the place erupted. They are all young people. We have an amazing thing happening, it’s just...






 Look, that’s their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you. It is disgusting. But when I started this journey and that’s what it is, it’s a journey and it’s a movement that’s taking place. It’s a movement. Remember the old days? Silent majority? It’s not right. It’s a noisy majority. People are angry. It’s a noisy majority. These aren’t silent people anymore. I go to people — you can’t even hear.


This is an amazing thing that’s happened. I received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that’s OK. (inaudible) a couple of them, right? But, a guy who’s really respected, recently, and he said, "How does it feel?" I said, "How does what feel?" He said, "What you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States." I mean, even CNN said, "Number one political story of the year is Trump." You know what number two was? ISIS — ISIS was two. I’d rather reverse it. Let ISIS be one; let me be two, because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.






Make me number one next year. But this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy. He said — he said, "What you’ve done has never been done before in the history of this country." Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, "This is one the great phenomenons (ph) I’ve ever seen in politics; nobody’s ever seen it."


Crowds like this? Forget it. I mean, it’s only confined to this (inaudible). Again, they sent 3,000 people home. Can you believe it? More than 3,000. It’s — it’s unbelievable what’s happening. It’s beautiful what’s happening. It’s beautiful what’s happening. But Newt Gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this.


But he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before." I said, "Well, you know, it’s fine, but if I don’t win, it’s just a waste of time." He goes, "No, no, no. What you’ve done is incredible." He said, "Even if you don’t win, what you’ve done is incredible; you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics."






No, don’t applaud, don’t applaud, don’t applaud. He said, "You’ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it’s forever going to be different. Your campaign — there’s never been anything like it." OK, he was very nice. I said, "You don’t understand. You don’t understand. If I don’t win, I will consider this" — and I mean this — "a total and complete waste of time." I really do.


So — because we’re not going to do anything. It’s wonderful. Oh, good, I had nice crowds. They’ll write about me every once in a while; every two years I’ll have a story, "Trump ran this rather good campaign." If we don’t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don’t win, it’s a terrible waste of time, because you’ll have somebody else in there. They won’t be able to do what I do. They’re not going to be able to. And even if you get one of these Republicans in, like, I didn’t finish the — so, the wall.


When I say "Mexico is going to pay," they all laugh. They all go "heh, heh, heh." They think it’s funny. Honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny. They’re laughing. You know, lightly, like "Oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha." They’re going to pay for the wall, folks. They’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They’re going to pay for the wall.


But I mention it, now they don’t laugh because they’re starting to agree with me. And then the other day, one of the people said — it was Ted Cruz, who is a nice guy. But he said, "We’re going to build a wall at the southern border." I said, "Look" — and my wife is sitting (inaudible) — where did that come from, right? No, Ted’s a good guy.


But he said on one of — I think it was on Fox, he was being interviewed. And he said, "We’re going to build a wall at the southern border." He didn’t say Mexico was going to pay was going to pay. He hasn’t gone that far yet, but believe me that’s going to happen. See, they’re all trying to catch up with me. Because when I did this stuff, it was very out there.


Now, I’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. But what happens is — so Ted’s up and he’s talking. And, you know, routinely we’re going to have the border; we’re going to have this and that. And we’re going to build a wall.


My wife is sitting there. She says, "Darling, did you hear that? He just said they’re going to build a wall. That’s the first time I’ve — you know, that’s what you say." She hasn’t heard that from any other candidate.


OK. So we’re going to build a wall. Mexico is going to pay for it. There are so many things we’re going to do. But when I — when I started the journey, it was amazing. I came down — it took courage. I went down in to the lobby of Trump Tower, on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen — it looked like the Academy Awards, the press. We have a lot of press here today. They’re all live — look at all those live cameras.






So when I came down — when I came down on the escalator, we came down. And I said, "We’re going to do things." And I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldn’t even be talking about illegal — it wasn’t even on the radar. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right? Now, it’s one of the big subjects.


 And that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and I’m so proud of it, CNN just came out with a poll a couple of, I guess a week ago — 36 percent for Trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12. So they’re way down. But on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent. That’s with 16 people at the time.






On the budget, I mean, I understand — the budget, the economy, I win — I win it hands down, all right.


But listen to this. On illegal immigration, I’m almost at 50 percent.






And on ISIS, likewise, almost at 50 percent. So people want to be protected, they want to feel safe. They need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts. I don’t want to be tough — you know, I know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart, and they’re the — they’re the easiest. You can be tough, you’ve got to be smart.


Let’s start smart first. You’ve got to be smart-tough. You’ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us. So what happens is this. I came out, I started — I did it, I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of this stuff. Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles. Jamiel Shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant. Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.


So many great people. And that’s — these are two, so many. And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? And all of a sudden, people are coming over, and I say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall. We have to be progressive in our thinking. When I say progressive, I mean like smart. I’m not talking progressive like a Bernie Sanders would say, the guy want to tax you. Think of it.






Think of it. This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent. No, no, think — you’ll have to move out of this — I love this area, by the way. I’ve been here many times. Great golfing area, right? We love it.






No more golf if Bernie Sanders — no more golf. No, no, you won’t have any golf anymore. There won’t be — you won’t have any money left to be — you’ll be paying it in taxes. This guy is a total disaster.


And I’m not saying that — I’ll tell you why. You know, Hillary said well, I’d like to run against Trump, believe me.


This poor Chuck Todd, Meet the Press. His show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but I never liked it. You know, I just — he never treated me fairly. So I do his show, he gets the highest ratings he’s had in years. He went from, like — believe me, I won’t even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right? I saved his life, and then he goes Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump. And yes — and they’re looking forward to it. Trust me, the last person — she’s already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?




 She had a tough night. She had a tough one. She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, OK?






So Hillary Clinton said — and here’s Chuck Todd — and he’s a nice guy. I’m not trying to knock him. Please don’t be insulted, Chuck. But she says she doesn’t like him. But he doesn’t treat me right. So he goes the Clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against Trump, like I’m some kind of a sap. So I call him and I say Chuck, let me explain something. When they say they want to run against me, that means they don’t want to run against me, do you understand that? Do you understand it’s reverse psychology.


They say they want to run against me — first of all, I’m winning and tied in the polls now and I haven’t even hit her yet. But look at what happened to all the guys I hit. They’re gonzo, they’re gone or they’re failing badly, OK, and they’ll be gone soon.


But Hillary Clinton — think of it. I say so Chuck, report it like properly. Trust me, they don’t want to run against Trump. The last thing she wants in her whole life is — this was only — I did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband’s one of the great abusers of the world? Give me a break. Give me a break.






Give me a break. So the last person she wants to run against is me.


Now here’s the story. Look, here’s the story. It’s very simple. So I announced — and I was talking about trade, I was talking about the wall, I was talking about the borders, I was talking about Obamacare, I was talking about the 2nd Amendment will be saved, by the way. The 2nd Amendment.






It will be saved. The 2nd Amendment is going to be with us if I’m president. You know, they’re doing everything. They want to get rid of the bullets now, they’re doing everything they can —


Think of Paris, think of Los Angeles. Think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side, right? They had no guns. Paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks. And France — I mean, you get caught with a gun, it’s — the only one that has guns are the bad guys. So they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind. He’s a moron. I mean, this guy was a moron. I call him the guy with the dirty hat, right? They got him so good. By the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles police did a phenomenal job. They did a great job.






Wouldn’t it be wonderful if, let’s see, this guy right here in front of me, he’s a tough guy. This guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he’s a strong-looking guy right here. This guy right there, see? And that one. Wouldn’t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist? Somebody. Him, him, him, so that when they — you know what they were doing in Paris? Get over here, boom. Get over here, boom. Your turn, get over here, boom. One hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals. Other people are going to die.


Same thing over there. These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage. There’s something going on, folks. It’s wrong. They gave them a party. They worked — they gave them a party. She came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.


And people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs — who the hell doesn’t know? You’re their next door neighbor. And they didn’t want to talk about it. You’ve got to report these people. We’ve got a real problem. You’ve got to report them. No more nonsense.


They didn’t report them, and the reason they didn’t is because they don’t disagree with them so much. OK? Believe me. It’s not because they were afraid. You saw the one who wasn’t politically correct to (ph) report them. They didn’t want to report them. I mean, give me a break. So we have to change.


So it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade, I was going to talk about all the things, I was going to talk about the military, building it up. I was going to do all of this, but after Paris and California, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after Paris and California, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.


It’s amazing. They went up 10 points. I said, "What, you think it was the debate?" Because I did good in the debate. They said, "No. People view you as a tough cookie that’s not going to take this crap." That’s what it is.






And now I talk about protection. I talk about — trust me. The trade — that’s so easy for me. I’ve got the greatest guys in the world. They’re going to come in, they’re going to do a great job. I’m going to do some myself. I always talk about Ford. They’re going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico. That’s not going to happen with me. That stuff is — those deals are no good.


Ford’s leaving. They’re closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant in — in Mexico. How the hell does that help us? OK. Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us? And in the meantime, in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they’re spending — think about a $2.5 billion — then they’re going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the United States, no tax, no nothing.


I’ll say you don’t have to pay a tax, folks. And you know what? Ford will say "If I (inaudible) pay a tax, we’re going to stay in the United States." I mean, it’s very simple.






It’s very simple. How about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced a big — Chicago. They announced they’re going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants and they’re going to move it to Mexico. What’s my statement? We’re not eating oreos anymore, right? No more.


But I don’t want this. It’s not going to happen. Then they’re make — they’re going to make product and they’re going to sell it into the United States? Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. And by the way, I’m a free trader. I believe — we’ve got to be smart. I mean, we’ve got to get something. We don’t get anything out of anything. We don’t get anything.


We lose on everything. That Iran deal was a disaster. By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second. I always — and this came to me two weeks ago. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner. Very disappointed with myself.






The Iran deal is the worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated, OK? I’m wrong. You know what the worst deal is? Iran’s a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. That’s even better. Think of it. We gave Iran Iraq. Iran has the biggest — think of it. They’re going to have the richest oil — if you go to Iraq, take a look. Among the largest oil reserves in the world.


We gave them, by decapitating Iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give Iraq. So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq. We gave them Iraq, that they’ve been after for 100 years. We handed it to them.


So now, they have the largest oil reserves among — in the world. That’s even better than the original deal. I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job. OK? If that was a stock, you’ve got to buy some.


So we are not going to have deals like that with me. It’s not going to happen. We’re going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again. And...






And you’re going to remember this moment. This is going to be an important moment for all of us. The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote. It’s going to be your turn.






Number three. Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa. We go to New Hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks. We’ve got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start. No matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote. Because if you don’t, it’s not going to happen.


Don’t sit back and say, oh, Trump is going to do well. The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate. But you have got to go out and vote. And I will tell you this. It has been an honor to be here, I love this area, I love the people here. It’s been an honor.






But we will make America great again, I promise. Thank you.


 (OFF-MIKE) Thank you very much, everybody. Well, I want to begin by thanking the people of South Carolina. This is a special state. Thank you. These are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- New Hampshire. We can't forget it. Special, special. We love it. And they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right?






 Very good feeling. So I really want to thank you and my volunteers. All of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and I say, "what are you doing?" And now they're going to Texas and they're going all over. Some are going to Nevada. I'll be going to Nevada. We're making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we're going right to Nevada.


And I think we're going to do terrific and the SEC's (ph) going to be very, very exciting. We expect to do very, very well. Very well ...






 I want to just say thank you to my family. It's been not easy for them. They don't see me anymore. I'm making speeches all the time and I have a great. I really have a great family so I just want to thank all of you.


And Ivanka -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case. In South Carolina we're going to have a baby. There's nothing wrong with that, right? So ...






 Could be -- it could be any second. It could even be before I'm finished but it's -- but she insisted on being here. It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here so thank you. Really good and Jared, Vanessa, Don.


We have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process.






 You know Henry, right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina. I will take him over the governor anytime because we won. We won ...






 He handle that very nicely. He's tough. He's very tough. Tiffany, Eric, Lara and Melania. Melania, say something. Go ahead, please ...






M. TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina. Congratulation to my husband. He was working very hard and he loves you. We love you and we're going ahead to Nevada. And we will see what happen (sic). He would be the best president ...






 And representing some very, very wonderful children, Ivanka. Just say a few words.






I. TRUMP: Thank you, South Carolina. This is an amazing, amazing night. The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people. So as our family we're incredibly proud. We're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us. And I will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you. So together we'll make America great again. Thank you ...






 Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching. And some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much. But a number of the pundits said, "well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal Trump."


But these geniuses -- they're geniuses -- they don't understand that as people drop out I'm going to get a lot of those votes also. You don't just ...






 You don't just add them together. So I think we're going to do very, very well. I think we're going to do very well. I want to also congratulate the other candidates. In particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as I understand. No, come on. Just one minute. Come on. One second, right? Good.


OK. We go back to war tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning we'll be back but I just want to congratulate the other candidates. There's nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you. It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful.


(LAUGHTER)


 When you win it's beautiful and we're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country. We're going to start winning.






 Because our country doesn't win anymore. Doesn't win. We don't win with the military, we can't beat ISIS. We have great military but we can't beat ISIS. We don't win on trade. You look at what China's doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade. Mexico is killing us -- absolutely. We'll do the wall. Don't worry. We're going to do the wall.


  We're going to do the wall and by the way, who's going to pay for the wall?






 Mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy. The other politicians come down, "you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall." I said, "100 percent." We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. The wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, OK? Believe me, they will pay. One of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference.


And he announced that we will not be paying for the wall. Who does Mr. Trump think he is? They came to me -- the press. These people -- look at all those cameras back there.






 The press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall. Do you have a comment? I said, "yes. The wall just got 10 feet taller."






 It's true. And I love Mexico. I love Mexico, I love China, I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don't know what they're doing. I love these countries. They're great. I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics. We're going to Nevada.


I lead -- I lead with the Hispanics. I'm leading in every poll with the Hispanics. They love me, I love them. The problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's Mexico or Japan or Viet Nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or China in particular -- that's the big one. The greatest abuse of a country that I think I've ever seen financially -- China.


What they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. They've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything. We're bringing our jobs back, folks. We're bringing our jobs back. We're going to bring them back ...






 And I know how to do it. We've had so many -- we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important. Carl Icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.


And we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when China wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now. They're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.


  So we're going to do a lot of beautiful work. We're going to terminate Obamacare. It's going to terminated. It's going to be over ...






 It's going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced. And you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because Obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your Obamacare. Twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent. It's dead. It's not working. We're going to go to a plan that's going to be so much better and so much less expensive.






 So second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second amendment. Thank you, fellows. This is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment. We are going to protect our second amendment. Totally ...






 Common core is gone. We are getting rid of common core. We're brining education to a local level. The people in this community -- every time I see them they want education locally. The parents, the teachers. They want to do it -- they don't want bureaucrats in Washington telling them how to educate their children.






 We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. Not even close. More per pupil -- second place doesn't even exist it's so different. And yet out of 30 countries we're ranked number 30. You have China, you have Norway, Swenden, Denmark and then you have number 30, the United States. So we spend the most and we're at the bottom of the heap. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore.






 We are going to build our military which I thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in Washington I -- we love our military.






 We love our military. And by the way we love our police. Our police are terrific. We love our police ...






 They are not being treated properly. We're going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks.


  And we're going to buy -- we're going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that's in the know want. We're not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph). Because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions.


We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington. We're going to have great equipment.






 And the reason I can say that is I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...






 I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want. That's not going to happen. And we're going to take care of our vets. We love our vets and they're being treated terribly. We're taking care of our vets.






 So we're now off to Nevada and it's a great state. We have great people. We have great people in our nation. No matter where we go -- I went to Mobile, Alabama -- 35,000 people. We went to Oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people, 20,000 people. No matter where we go we fill up the arenas.


Over here the other day we had a 9,000 -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people. The only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can't get them in. We have to send thousands of people away.


Time Magazine -- Time Magazine last year did an incredible cover story. They said "it's a movement." And that's what it is. It's an incredible movement with incredible people. Incredible people.






 It's an incredible movement with incredible people. I tell you. And whether we go -- honestly whether we go to Dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to L.A. -- you go anywhere you say. Our people are incredible. And our theme -- what's our theme? You know it, right?






 Our theme which I love may be the greatest theme of all time, right? And the word again eventually is going to come off. We're going to get rid of the whole theme because what's going to happen -- make America great again, right?


And the last two weeks because I've gotten to see so many -- I guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches. And I've met so many people. But the people are so incredible that I've been saying make America great again and it's going to be greater than ever before. That's the kind of potential we have. Greater then every before.


I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech. Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:


"When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They’re not sending you (pointing again). They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. They’re bringing drugs.They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people! But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast."


What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn’t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican
government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans—many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.


The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it’s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.


I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesn’t want me to say. In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.


I have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States. I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President. Macy’s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government. The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.


Interestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock price—not to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract. Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest backers. After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"—there was very little criticism. It wasn’t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.


The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again! Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created. Let’s get to work!






TRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what’s going on, and especially how poor she’d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism.
TRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, who’s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon.
But today, there’s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.
So many people — it’s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace. The horror is beyond description. The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever. Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.
We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. We mourn as one people for our nation’s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it. I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.
Thank you. Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando’s LGBT community. They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. This is a very dark moment in America’s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.
It’s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. It’s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It’s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.
We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination. But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. We’re not acting clearly, we’re not talking clearly, we’ve got problems.
If we don’t get tough, and if we don’t get smart, and fast, we’re not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left. The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.
His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty. The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.
That is a fact, and it’s a fact we need to talk about. We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly. We have an incompetent administration.
And if I’m elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. We have an administration that will not change. But if I get in there, it’s going to change, and it’s going to change quickly. We’re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.


TRUMP: Thank you.
With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. We have to address these issues head-on. I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on. We have to do it.
It will be lifted — this ban — when and as a nation we’re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. They’re pouring in and we don’t know what we’re doing. The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. Now, any class — it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States. And it’s as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully it’s he in this case.


Thank you. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I’m elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. After a full ...


Thank you.
And by the way we have no choice. After a full and partial and long — really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.


We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.
 Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.


I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.


This is not just a national security issue. It’s a quality of life issue. If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans — women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.


We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores. And it’s coming ...


With these people, folks, it’s coming. We’re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we’re letting into America. All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas. Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.
The Boston bombers came here through political asylum. The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.


TRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold — five fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more, and that’s just the way it is. We admit many more from other countries in the region.
And I’ll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values. We want to remain a free and open society. Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders. We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later. Right now.


Thank you.
Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday. And, guess what, she will probably say them. She sort of has said them, but let’s see what happens. She really has no choice, but she doesn’t want to.
However, she’s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words. She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what’s going wrong with our country and our borders. She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. She’s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world — true weakness.
I don’t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that’s all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words "radical Islam." Here is what she said, exact quote, "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism." That is Hillary Clinton.
So, she says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.
Thank you.
She wants to take away American’s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. Let them come into the country, we don’t have guns. Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.
I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment.


Thank you. Thank you.
The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing. In fact, Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It’s deadly — totally deadly.
The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information. We need this information so badly, and he stopped it. We don’t have the support. We don’t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job. They are not being allowed to do their job. And, they can do it well — better than anybody.
We need a new leader. We need a new leader fast.


TRUMP: Thank you.
They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.


I want to do the right thing. I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.


The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I’m elected. As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. They don’t have those tools now.


We need an intelligence gathering system second to none. Second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly. I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who’ll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.


And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It’s not right.


We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th. Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama’s Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These Departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why. They refused to comply.
President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th. So important. The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?


We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple. We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America. Not complicated.


Every – and just think of this. Take a look. Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases. Just a single event. And just one person. Can you imagine what they’ll do in large groups, which we’re allowing now to come here.
Truly our President doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s failed us and he’s failed us badly. Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse. And I’ve been saying that for a long time. Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.
In fact, Clinton’s State Department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me, tell me – how stupid is that?
This could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was. Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children. Not only their children, by the way, they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we don’t know what’s happening.
TRUMP: The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen. We’re not screening people.
So why don’t we have an effective screening system? We don’t. We’re being laughed at all over the world. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.
Wouldn’t this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here. We have cities, we have inner cities...


We have poverty all over and this is how we’re spending billions of dollars. We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States. We don’t know who they are, they have no documentation and we don’t know what they’re planning and we won’t unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they’re out of here. What I want...



What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values. That’s a choice I put before the American people. A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton’s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests. That’s all it is. We’ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we’ve got to do it now because later is too late — going to be too late for our country.
The media talks about home grown terrorism but Islamic radicalism and that’s a very, very important term — a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don’t like it. Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.
But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing people who add to the problem. And that’s what they’re doing. We’re letting all of these people — hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they’re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.
For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?
Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views or values.


She can’t have it both ways. She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities. How does this kind of immigration make our lives better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? Why? Explain.
Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?
TRUMP: I will tell you who the better friend is and some day I believe that will be proven out bigly (ph).


And by the way the LGBT community is just — what’s happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, I will tell you right now.
Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country. They enslave women, and they murder gays. I don’t want them in our country.


Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities. All of our communities, every single one of them. Americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on Earth, anybody in the world. Four times more. At least, because we don’t even know who’s coming in. And we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged. In almost 20 years. You wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why I’ve gotten more votes than any Republican in any primary in the history of the Republican Party? Take a look at that. Take a look at your security, take a look at the wages. For 18 years they’ve been stagnant, they’ve even gone down.
So whether it’s a matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. Cannot afford it. We owe $19 trillion in debt. And no longer have any options. Our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone. It’s really an act of defense. I want us all, all of us, to work together. We have to form a partnership, with our Muslim communities. We have Muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership.
Now, the Muslim community, so important. They have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. They know it. And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith. I want to fix our schools. I want to fix our bridges. And our jobs market, we’re going to have it rocket again, we’re going to make great trade deals. But I want every American to succeed including Muslims.
But the Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what’s going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn’t turn them in. And you know what? We had death, and destruction.
Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens. I want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens. The terrorist attack on Pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault. In San Bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it. They said oh, "We thought so but we didn’t want to use racial profiling." Which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don’t get in trouble.
We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates. We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status. We have to know, and we have to know fast. We need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with. We need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didn’t tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know what’s going on and they don’t tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences. Big consequences.


America must do more — much more — to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando.
TRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy. The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.
These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region. That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building. No more nation building. It’s never going to work.
And by the way we’ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster. We’re further away now than we were 15 years ago. For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton’s war in Libya. That mission helped to unleash ISIS on a new continent.
I’ve said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism. We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. Since I’ve raised that criticism and it’s OK. I’ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details — NATO has since announced a new initiative — front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that. America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.


Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War. We tried it President Obama’s way, doesn’t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS and many other problems in return. That’s what we got. Remember the famous apology tour. We’re sorry for everything.
I’d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of Orlando who have come under this horrific attack. When I’m president I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, I don’t care. All Americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected.


Thank you. Thank you. We’re going to be tough and we’re going to be smart and we’re going to do it right. America will be a tolerant and open society. America will also be a safe society. We will protect our borders at home. We will defeat ISIS overseas. We have no choice. We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety. We will make America rich again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.


Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you.


Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state.
In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.
In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk and I’m glad I did.
But I didn’t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That’s what politicians do. All talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother. The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.
My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East.
The problem here is fundamental. We have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.
I’ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else. Believe me, and it’s a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they’ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.
The deal doesn’t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Iran’s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.
When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I’m not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that’s why I’m going to be elected president folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that please.
Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I’ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets. like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.
Now they’re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank they’re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist’s home that’s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and it’s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.
Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran’s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.
Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable. And we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. Believe me.
Iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe, and maybe someday hit even the United States. And we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not letting it happen, and we’re not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.
Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi, were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth." You can forget that!
What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here’s, you talk about twisted, here’s another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made! The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, we will, I promise we will.
Which brings me to my next point. The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It’s not a friend to freedom. It’s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel.
With President Obama in his final year, yay! He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me. Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.
So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear. An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent.
When people ask why, it’s because that’s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together. They come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where there’s value in exchange for something that it requires. That’s what a deal is. A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That’s not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It’s not going to happen folks.
And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they’re stabbing Israelis, and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don’t reward behavior like that. You can not do it! There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it!
So, it’s not up the United Nations to go with a solution. It’s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. You have no choice. They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don’t even really know what’s happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It’s so preposterous. We’re not going to let that happen. When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.
You see, I know about deal-making. That’s what I do. I wrote ‘The Art of the Deal’. One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, I’m saying ‘one of’, because I’ll be criticized as though I say ‘the’, so I’m going to be very diplomatic. One of... I’ll be criticized. I think it is number one, but why take a chance. One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.
To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn’t even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn’t even respond.
When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One. And when I say something, I mean it. I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.
Meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews. It has to stop. When you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero’s, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. we can’t let this continue. We can’t let this happen any longer.
You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible, horrible way to think. It’s a barrier that can’t be broken. That will end, and it’ll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you’ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they’ve got to go out, and they’ve got to start this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it, and now!
There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. And you see that happening all the time. That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn’t happen.
President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it’s precisely the opposite that happened. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it’s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We’ll get it solved, one way or the other. We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially. That’s what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States.
We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State.
I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I’ve been with Israel so long in terms of, I’ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel. My father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as I’m concerned.
So I want to thank you very much. This has been a truly great honor. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Wow. Thank you very much. Hello. I’d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California. We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.
I’m truly honored by your support. Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful, remember that.
Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes. This is a great feeling. That’s a great feeling.
This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible. You’ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it, folks. We’re going to do it.
I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down – too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears. I’m never going to let you down. I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is, is a movement.
Now recent polls have shown that I’m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially. To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you. I want to thank you very, very much.
To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support. To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms. And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and he’s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that’s what I do. We are going to have fantastic trade deals. We’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
Now I know some people say I’m too much of a fighter. My preference is always peace, however and I’ve shown that. I’ve shown that for a long time. I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always. My goal is always again to bring people together. But if I’m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
Thank you. I’ve fought for my family. I’ve fought for my business. I’ve fought for my employees. And now, I’m going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before. And I’m not a politician fighting, I’m me. You’re going to see some real good things happen.
Just remember this: I’m going to be your champion. I’m going to be America’s champion because you see this election isn’t about Republican or Democrat; it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people and I mean the American people.
Every election year politicians promise change. Obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well. And every year they fail to deliver. Why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? That’s what they’re doing, folks. Why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very, very wealthy? I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could’ve done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.
After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently. We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars. Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something about how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands.
Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her – not right. I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.
Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund – the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese – all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It’s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
I didn’t need to do this. It’s not easy, believe me. I didn’t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family. I’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s eyes. I’ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible. I’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country – remember it, folks, remember it.
I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools. I’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it’s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what’s happened to our country. America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder. We’re broke, we’re broke. We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.
What a crowd, what a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country, we love our country. But we can turn this all around. We’re going to do it by putting America first. That commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time. It’s important to understand what America First means. It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation. This is the opposite of Hillary’s foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks. We have made them that way.
You better hope I’m President. On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition. What’s happening there is absolutely a disgrace. No PPP, you’re right about that and you mean no PP. We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that. We’re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico. If it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering bigly and it’s getting worse.
On energy policy, America First means opening up America’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration.
On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level. We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation. No matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies. The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it’s got to be that way. Now, the people in charge say things can’t change. I’m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change.
We’re going to put America back to work. We’re going to make our own products. We’re going to put America back to work. We’re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad. We’re going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long. We’re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again. Together, we will put the American people first again, first again.
We will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again. Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.


Thank you for joining me today.


This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.


Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.


There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.


But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.


The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.


So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.


The horror is beyond description.


The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.


We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.


We mourn, as one people, for our nation’s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.


I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.


[SILENCE]


Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.


This is a very dark moment in America’s history.


A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.


It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.


It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.


It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.


We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.


But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.


If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.


The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.


The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.


That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.


We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.


We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.


With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.


I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.


The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.


I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.


After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.


We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.


Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.


Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.


I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.
It’s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.


If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.


We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.


We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.


Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.


All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.


Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.


The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.


The male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.


Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.


We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.


If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.


Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.


However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won’t speak honestly about what it is.


She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.


In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."


Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans’ guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.


I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.


The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.


In fact, Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.


When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.


The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.


I refuse to be politically correct.


I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.


The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.


As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.


We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.


I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.


We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.


The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.


Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.


These Departments refused to comply.


President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.


The public has a right to know how these people got here.


We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.


We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.


Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?


Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.


Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.


In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.


Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.


This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.


We can't let this happen.


Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.


The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.


The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.


The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.


Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?


We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.


What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.


That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.


We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.


The media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.


Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.


For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.


This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?


Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views.


She can’t have it both ways. She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.


How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?


Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?


Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.


I don’t want them in our country.


Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities.


America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.


Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years.


So whether it’s matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.


All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.


I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.


I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.


I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.


The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.


In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.


We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.


We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.


We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.


We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.


If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .


America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.


It also means we must change our foreign policy.


The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.


These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.


That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.


For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.


I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.


America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.


We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.


I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.


When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.


America will be a tolerant and open society.


America will also be a safe society.


We will protect our borders at home.


We will defeat ISIS overseas.


We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.


We will make America rich again.


We will make America safe again.


We will make American Great Again.


Thank you.


...We’re doing really well. Iowa’s been amazing. It’s been amazing. We’re doing so well and I love this place and I’m back here all the time and I’m going to be here a lot in January.
You’re going to be so sick of me. You’ll probably say, "We can’t give – the caucus, just forget it. We can’t stand the guy any more."
No, you’re going to like me and we’re going to be back and we’re going to do a great job for you. Most importantly, we’re going to get to that office and we’re going to do the right thing. We’re going to do the right thing.
So, a few things. A lot – so much has happened.
You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we’re just doing so great with the border security.
We’re going to build a wall. Mexico’s going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we’re going to have security. And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they’re going to come into the country they’re going to be legal, they’re coming in legally, and that’s the way. That’s the way.
And it affects Iowa so much.
So we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It’s going to be repealed. It’s going to be replaced.
I don’t know if you’ve been seeing what’s happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It’s dying of its own weight.
And by ’17, meaning he’ll be playing golf and I’ll be working very hard. But ’17 instead you’re not getting the people signed up. There’s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it.
Obamacare’s dead but we’ll terminate it quicker than that.
And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better.
Premiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you’re close to death, you’ll never going to get to use. And even then I don’t think you’re going to get to use it really.
So, we’re going to take care of that.
And by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really – we have the ethanol – where are the ethanol people? Right?
I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it’s so important. And it’s another form of let’s stay away from OPEC and let’s stay away from that Middle East stuff. It’s so important...
Actually what I don’t understand because the one guy that’s doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he’s a nice guy. I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say.
I was going to do one really wild but he agrees.
But with the ethanol, really, he’s got to come a long way because he’s right now for the oil.
But I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He’s got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money.
But I’m with you. I’m with everybody. Look, I’m self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they’re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they’re representing companies that are ripping off our country.
All I do is I’m going to be working for you folks. We’re going to do this thing together. We’re going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important.
So when we first started, I talked about China how they’re ripping us and Japan and Mexico.
Mexico both at the border and in trade. They’re taking so many of our companies. Nabisco’s moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee – a great state – they took it away at the last moment.
I’m not going to let that stuff. We’re going to do what we have to do, okay?
But I talked about that...and I talk about it a lot. The fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with Paris, I’m speaking a little bit differently now.


Believe me, I can take care of China in my back pocket. That’s easy for me. That’s what I do.
And we have all the cards. A lot of people don’t know. You know, these politicians they don’t understand we have the cards.
You know, with China, our people pay tax. They pay no tax. It’s not supposed to be that way. They call it a tariff because it sounds better. But we’ll take care of that. We’ll take care of all of that.
What happened is with Paris, there’s a different mindset.
And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me.
Now, maybe it had to do – who knows why? Who knows?
But my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there’s something that I do that’s proper but controversial, they’d say "Oh, now he’s gone. That’s it. That’s the end."
I won’t go over all of the different things because maybe you’ll change your minds.
But they’d say, "That’s it. It’s over."
And then they’d come in, "Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week." I said, "They did?" Because I have to do what’s right. I have to do what’s right.
And you know what? If I don’t make it, I don’t make it.
I have a good life. We all hopefully have a good life. I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. They love me. I think. I hope. I think. But I have a great family and I built a great business.
...There’s such spirit...There’s such spirit no matter where I go. You know, I go to Dallas. We have 20,000. 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20,000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be...for like a record.
It is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good...
...So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I’m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness.
Sort of interesting. You know, the slogan is "Make America Great Again" and I’m adding "Make America Great Again and Safe Again" because we don’t feel safe anymore.
And the problem we have now that we’ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It’s the power. It’s the tremendous power.
You know, 100 years ago, I would have said "Let’s not go." I said "Don’t go there" anyway. And I said it strongly "Don’t go. You’re going to destabilize the Middle East."
But the fact is right now, we’re going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates.
And the press – look at all those cameras going all live, all – you know, nobody else has cameras like this. They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. Look at this.
And don’t worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That’s why I’m walking around. I figured I’ll walk around maybe they’ll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them "Pan the crowd", they never do.
...I had a crowd 7,000 people last week. More. 7,000 people and in a confined space. They had 3,000 people outside that couldn’t get in. My wife says, "Darling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there?" I said "What?" She said, "Well, they never leave your face." They keep it purposely. But I’ll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can’t move them, right?
But every time there’s a protester "Well, I’m protesting" and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.
No, I used to think they couldn’t move. You know, maybe there’s something with the crazy computers.
You know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You’d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes.
Well, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn’t think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons. And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn’t believe possible.
So, they’re very dishonest people. What can I say? Not all of them but most of them.


I’ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. The Des Moines Register is the worst. They are the worst. The worst. No, they’re very dishonest.
You have some reporter named Jacobs. She is the worst. She will write – so – it’s such misrepresentation. And so I don’t care. I mean, who cares? So I’m saying it right in their backyard. They’re failing anyway. They probably won’t be in business in two years. I think they’re losing a fortune. I think.
You know, it’s funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly.
...I’m only doing this so they don’t sue me but I don’t mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don’t have enough money to sue me. That’s the good thing.
But I believe and I may be wrong – in fact, I’ll say I’m sure I’m wrong but it’s my opinion that they don’t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. I’ll explain it...You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. "Oh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one."
Now, I don’t know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register?
But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don’t know why.
But we had a great poll come in – CNN last couple of days – where we’re leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa.
And then we have another coming where we’re doing well.
But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it’s coming out sometime. I’ll just tell you, watch – "Trump disappears!"
I think we’re going to do so well. I think we’re actually going to even do better. You know, we’re leading in most of the poll. We’re leading in every poll.
Except Iowa there was one poll – there was one poll, Monmouth – I’d never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don’t like Monmouth. You know why I don’t like it? Because they always treat me badly also.
But I only like polls that treat me well.
But we’re doing so well. Nationwide, we’re leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia – 44%. 44%. Think of that. That’s 44% with 15 people. I’d take 44% if we had three people. I don’t think I’d take it if we had two people but I think I’d take if we had three. But 44%.
CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we’re at 35% to a small number. We’re killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here.
...Again, I’m sure when Des Moines comes out it’ll be a negative because I don’t believe that poll.
But we are going to win. And I’ll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, "Oh, let’s not do" – I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I’m a Presbyterian. I’m a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham.
Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out – I don’t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there’s nobody, nobody that I’ve ever seen – Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody’s gone to his crusades, they were incredible.
But so I think we’re going to do – we’re doing really well with the evangelicals...
And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It’s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless.
I think we’re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We’re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party.
And we’re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We’re doing great with everybody.
And so it’s very important for me to win Iowa.


Now, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, "Oh, I don’t care about Iowa. I don’t care." But I do care. I do care so much about it. That’s why we’re here all the time.
And then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, "The people of Iowa can’t be that stupid or the people of the country can’t – ". I’m trying to make a point, right? So I said, "The people of the country can’t be that stupid." Well, they cut the "country" out so it’s referring to Iowa.
I love you people. Remember that. Remember that.
I was talking about something, and I won’t even mention what I’m talking about because the guy I’m talking about and was actually a very good guy.
But I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we’d run the table. I really do. I think we’d run the table. We’d go right through.
Because we’re leading big in New Hampshire – every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It’s the weirdest deal I’ve ever seen.
And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, "Are you sure about that? Nobody ever called us." They can’t believe it. And we can get into that but it’s irrelevant.
But we’re leading New Hampshire big. We’re leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We’re leading...Nevada. We’re leading in Texas. We’re leading everywhere. We’re leading big in Florida.
Now, you have Rubio – nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you’ve got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you’ve got to go and vote. You can’t be the number one person that doesn’t vote in the Senate. You’ve got to say, "Hey, I’m a young guy. I want to go and vote." You should stay there a little longer. He’s a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.
But I don’t know. How’s he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He’s not doing well. How’s Rubio doing? Not good.
I mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and it’s an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it’s very important.
So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we’d just go through. I think we’ll win virtually every state in the Union and it’s over quickly. Over quickly.
...What about the Republican establishment? The establishment’s got a problem, you know. It’s sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they’ll go into the hometown of a guy they’re fighting and they’ll say, "You know, we’d never want to get a decision. We go for the knock-out. The knock-out is the knock-out." Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it’s a decision and they say, "Uh, we’re in a problem" and they’d lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely – knock out.
So, if we win Iowa, I think we’re going to win everything after that. So I think it’s going to show how important Iowa is.
...I’ll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I’ll pledge it, okay? I don’t think I’ve ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa’s staying right where it is in the chain. It’s not moving. You know, there’s a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. Folks, I win it’s not happening, okay? You’re staying right here because it’s great. It’s great.




...You’ve been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way. Let’s put them in. Because Medicare does work. With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. We’re going to take care of that. Okay?
But we’re not going to cut your Social Security and we’re not cutting your Medicare. We’re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We’re going to become a wealthy country again. And we’re going to be able to save your Social Security.
...I can’t believe this number but I read it over – who is the man that told me the number – over 6 million people – I can’t believe it – are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security...But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous – like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They’re dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up...
...The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million – now, we know there’s not 6 million, there may be one. But there’s not 6 million.
Anybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand.
But – so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that’s the beginning. So there’s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.
What we’re going to do is we’re going to save Medicare. We’re going to save Social Security. We’re not going to raise the age or we’re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They’re all talking about doing it, and you don’t have to. We’re going to bring our jobs back. We’re going to make our economy incredible again.
My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it’s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups.
But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated.
And when that happens, you’re going to see an economy that takes off. We’re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we’re going to get rid of it – you know, we’re at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right.
You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn’t even a word anybody knew and now it’s like routine.
So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We’re going to bring the economy back. We’re going to make ourselves rich again.
A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, "Mr. Trump, I’m voting for you. I love you. But it’s very crude when you say you’re going to make our country rich again." I said, "I know it’s crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can’t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can’t let everybody in the world rip us off.


...We just did a big interview with CNN just before this. And you know, Hillary – was Hillary missing today? What happened? She was two hours late. No, did you hear?
Now, I may be wrong. If I’m one minute off, they’ll call me because they love Hillary. They love her. You know why. I don’t know why. Why? I’m trying to figure it. No, I heard she was a couple of hours late. Everybody left. You know what happened? She was sleeping. I’m telling you. She couldn’t get out of bed. She was sleeping. She was sleeping. Was right.
...




Remember, we built China. The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China. You go there, they have bridges all over the – they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge. Maybe I shouldn’t mention that particular bridge. But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge. Only a few people got that one; that’s okay.
But they have bridges going up. We have rebuilt China. They’ve taken our jobs. They’ve taken our base. They’ve taken our manufacturing all over the place. They’ve taken our money. They’ve taken our money. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen.
I know the great business people. We have the greatest business people in the world. Guys like Carl Icahn. He calls me, "Donald, I want to help. I want to help." The smartest people call. We’re not going to use the special interest guy – a donor.
We use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. Because again, I’m the only one that’s self-funding my campaign. Everybody else isn’t.
These guys – when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want.
That’s not going to happen with me.
So, Social Security – we’re saving it. Medicare – we’re saving it. We’re going to make our country rich. Okay? Thank you, sweetheart.


...Yeah, it’s called the statute of limitations, right? And you know it’s a six-year year statute. Maybe five but it’s probably six. But it’s a six-year statute. Yeah, you have to look at it.
Look, Hillary Clinton – you know this story. It’s a crime. She committed a crime.
Now, perhaps – perhaps – somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps...we’ll have some really good Attorney General that’s going to say "Well, you know".
Look, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion.
Now, she shouldn’t be allowed to run. She’s being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they’re going to find anything. But they’ve already found it.
I mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, "Yes, she violated section so and so". Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws.
You mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing.
So I think she’s going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she’ll be allowed to run. She’s being protected by the Democrats. She’s being protected by the President. And that’s why – why do you think she’s going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything.
I don’t even – honestly in all fairness to her, I don’t think she believes it. But I think she’s afraid he’s going to say, "Listen, I don’t like her anymore. Go take care of her. I’m going to get somebody else." I’m telling you.
So, the question is statute of limitations. It’s a five year statute of limitations. She’s got a problem. She’s got a problem. In one way, she’s running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that’s the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem.
...


...Well, I said right at the beginning. We’re going to build a wall that’s going to be a real wall. That’s going to be a real wall.
It’s not going to be – you see that ceiling? That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. And we can build it and we can build it right. And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. It’s got to be beautiful because someday they’re going to name it the Trump Wall. I know that. It’s going to happen. Going to happen.
And it’s going to work. And walls do work.
You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn’t get environmental impact statements. That’s just shows you.
China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They’re not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They’re not supposed to be doing that. And you could get them to stop just by saying "We’re not doing business with you anymore." Their whole economy would – you don’t have to go to war. It’s economics. The whole country would collapse in two seconds. Believe me. We have such power and we don’t know it.
But they’re building massive – now, they had little islands. They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they’re using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who’s Chinese from China – very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? – I said jokingly "How long did it take them to do these massive islands they’re building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?" He laughed. He said, "What are you kidding me? Nothing." They say "We will build there." About two seconds later, you have escavators digging.
So we had a problem with environmental – look, I’ve won many environmental awards. I’m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I’m a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I’ve gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I’ve won many, many awards.
But when you look at how we’re impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn’t get an environmental impact statement.
Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don’t know. But they actually had people – a lot of people – people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn’t get it done.
...You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I’ve been saying that for three years. Now finally they started – after Paris they started bombing the oil. I’ve been saying it for years.
You know one of the reasons we didn’t bomb the oil? Obama didn’t want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn’t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today.
I’m telling you, folks, we’re being led by stupid people. We’re being led by stupid people.
I’ve been saying not really bomb – I’ve been saying take the oil. I didn’t want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said "Look, we shouldn’t have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way."
First of all, we have a president who told them a date. "We’re going to leave on such and such a date." What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, "Wow", ‘cause don’t believe it. They don’t want to be killed. Okay? They don’t want to be killed. So the enemy said "They’re going to leave on a certain date?" So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It’s a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq.
So anyway, I couldn’t believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces "We are sending 50 soldiers."
Okay, first of all, he thinks it’s a good press announcement. It’s not. 50 soldiers – that’s not a lot even though they’re the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart.
Why does he have to say that for? Why can’t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can’t he just do that? Why can’t he do that?
Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don’t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that’s the way it is.
We have people that don’t know what they’re doing.
We used to have General MacArthur – Douglas MacArthur – General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people.
Today, we have generals that go on talk shows...I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said – and this was serious and he’s a good man. They’re good men. But you’ve got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, "We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we’ve been in in decades." And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us.
And he said we are in the worst shape we’ve been in many, many decades.
Now, number one, he shouldn’t be saying that because you’re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn’t be saying it. We shouldn’t be saying it.
I mean, even if it’s true, you don’t say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite.
One thing I’m going to do I’ll tell you, I’m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful – so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody is going to mess with us.
You know in many ways, it’s the cheapest thing you can do. Everyone is toying with us right now. It’s the cheapest thing you can do. The absolute cheapest thing you can do.


...I’m a big Second Amendment person by the way.
...My sons are really great marksmen. They’re big believers. And I’m a member of the NRA but I’m not such a good shot. But they’re great shots so it’s one of those things.
But if you think about that question. So you know there’s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets. How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine? ...So the people will put three bullets in. I don’t think the bad guys are going to say, "Well, I don’t want to break the law. I’m going to go kill people today but I’m going to put three bullets in." Right?
These people – and you know I have arguments with them all the time and I’m a practical guy. Honestly, if I didn’t believe this, I couldn’t say it.
So in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York. It’s very hard to get. I have a license to carry.
But in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room – Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. France has the toughest gun laws in the world. Nobody has guns. Except the bad guys.
So they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, "Over here – boom. Over here – boom." So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now. They’re in terrible shape in the hospitals. They just wipe the place out and they could’ve stayed there for longer. They wiped it out.
Then you had those two sleaze bags from California. The married couple. I saw the press – "The young married couple that did the shooting". They’re not a young married couple. They’re the worst. They’re sleaze.
...They say "The young married couple". That’s no young married couple.
So they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people.
But if somebody had guns in there – nobody had a gun...How would you have done if you had a gun? Would you have been firing back a little bit? They’d been in trouble. Right? They would have been in trouble. Believe me. That guy.
So, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them. I talk to them. I said, "Okay, we’re in Paris. You have all these places and there’s hundreds of people. Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun. Don’t you think they would’ve been better if they had?" They can’t – they lose the argument but they never change their mind.
So we have to fight for the Second Amendment. It’s so simple. It’s so simple.
And believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they’re going to have them more so than ever before. So we’re going to protect the Second Amendment if I’m president. That I can tell you.
And by the way, we’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. Do you ever notice?
...And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. And happy holiday.
Frankly, I have a lot of friends that aren’t Christian. They like Christmas. Everybody likes Christmas. It’s politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas. But when I’m president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, don’t eat too much turkey. Right?
Okay, so we’re going to say Merry Christmas again folks. We’re going to bring that spirit back.


...I really do. I like Ted Cruz a lot. And he’s doing well. I’m doing well. I mean, it’s not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand. We have to make that – but I do like him.
And I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted, to be honest with you.
I mean, he’s somebody that I can certainly see that because I like him, he likes me. He actually put out a tweet tonight. He said "Donald Trump is" – I think he used the word – "terrific". That’s a nice word. I mean, whoever hears that?
I can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me. Right?
...


...So the Super PACs are horrible and I had many set up for me by people I didn’t know. I mean, I’d see them on television talking about – somebody named one "The Art of the Deal PAC". Two young guys. They look good. I mean, I don’t know.
But then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money. People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates. The whole thing is wrong.
And I see it. I mean, Bush has $125 million. Think of it. $125 million. By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn’t make any difference. Okay?
But Bush has $125 million. And honestly, he’s a nice person. He is. I don’t want to do that but he’s a very nice person. But it’s $125 million. And you’d say to yourself, "People give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million. You know what’s happening."
But some of the Super PACs are running campaigns. They’re actually running the campaign.
Another thing and it’s sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million. Of the $6 million – this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times – one of the candidates who’s a nice person so I’m not going to mention the name. You know, when I like people I like them. I’m a very loyal person.
Of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers – can you believe this? – they had $140,000 left for the campaign. That’s better than being a real estate broker. I’d rather do that than sell houses. $140,000 left. That was in the newspaper. I don’t know. I think I believe it.
But I’ve seen it. I saw it with the Romney campaign. Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney. I said what the hell is this? I mean, you give money and they get a cut.
Look, our laws are so corrupt. Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt. It’s so horrible. So horrible.
And I don’t necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think that’s a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs.
What you have to have is people have to know who it is. So you have to open up the process. Let people know. If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions. Puts a little pressure.
But the concept of the PAC is no good. It’s no good. It’s a very dangerous, terrible thing. So we will change our laws because you really have no choice. It’s so out of control. It’s so terrible.
But the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this. There’s so little money left over for the candidates, it’s one of the reasons why I’m so happy I’m doing my own.
We actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs. The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC. First of all, I’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money. Some guy has no money. He sets up a Trump something PAC. Nothing to do with me. Sets it up. All of a sudden he’s got $2 million sitting there. Right? People send in money. And that guy has no money. How much of that money do you think he’s going to use to do what he’s supposed to be doing? That’s common sense. So maybe all of it but I doubt it.
So we sent legal notices to every one that we could find. We don’t want their money. We said "Don’t do it. We don’t want it. And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you."
But the Super PAC concept is corrupt. It’s terrible and it should be ended. And we’re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific. Okay? Thank you.


...Well, look he’s [referring to Cruz] from Texas. To the best of my knowledge, there’s a lot of oil in Texas. Right? So you know, he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and he’s totally against ethanol and everything else you’re talking about.
And I’m not. I’m totally in favor.
And you know, it’s a big industry here. It’s a big industry.
You know, if that industry is upset, Iowa’s got problems.
I was amazed. I was here three weeks ago with the group...They were such amazing people...And I learned so much about it. I was in favor of it even before...
...Beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in Iowa. And I said to myself, if Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that’s very anti-Iowa. I don’t know how he wins in Iowa. I don’t know.
No, but I’m totally for it. Okay? Thank you.


...I was a member of the establishment six months ago. I gave $350,000 to the RGA. That’s the Republican Governors Association. I gave tremendous amounts of money away. I was like the fair haired boy.
Once I said I’m running, they said "What? You’re not supposed to run."
And then what happened – I ran against all these Senators and Governors. And everyone said "Well, I don’t know." My wife said "If you run, you’re going to win" because she understands that I like people – I love people and people love me. And she said "You will run but you actually have to go and run. You have to announce you’re running because nobody’s going to believe you’re running."
And so I didn’t want to announce because I didn’t want to like announce and things didn’t work out and I’m like some of these guys where they’re zero. Many of them zero.
And so finally I said, "Look, let’s – we’re going to do it. We have to do it."
Just too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made – Bergdahl – where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers. We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy – horrible traitor. We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they’ve wanted for nine years – the worst killers – and they’re all back on the battlefield.
You know, so many decisions. The Iran deal. The Iran deal. How bad is that? They self-inspect. "Okay, good. We’re not building. We promise we’re not building nuclear weapons." "Oh, okay. That’s okay."
And we give them $150 billion and we don’t even get our prisoners back. The whole thing is crazy. So I saw this. And I said to my wife, "Hey, I don’t know if I’ll do well or not. Who the hell knows?"
And it’s a risky thing. And I’ve always heard if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time. And the people go after me. I don’t even care at this point. I said, "I have to do it. Now, we’re going to have to do it."
And I look at it last time with Romney and I didn’t do it and I probably should have because he let us down. I mean, look, he let us down.
That was an election – we had a failed president. Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now. It’s true. And Romney let us down. That last month – it was like he wasn’t even campaigning.
I said, "Why aren’t you on Jay Leno? Why aren’t you on David Letterman? Why aren’t you doing it?" And he just didn’t do it. So he lost the election.
So I backed McCain, he lost. I backed Romney, he lost. This time I said I’m doing it myself, okay? We’re going to win. We’re going to win.
But there is an establishment out there. It’s a real establishment. Real people. And they’re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place. And they’re people that are used to giving donations and having control.
And they’re people that, you know, look when they call me I’ll treat them with respect but I’m not going to be doing bad things if it’s bad for the country. I’m not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan.
And I’m not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies – I’m all for free trade. I think it’s great. I’m for it. But it’s got to be smart trade. I’m not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through. How does that help us, folks? I went to the best business school in the world. Believe me, it doesn’t help us. Okay? Trust me.
And we’re not going to make deals like that anymore. We can’t. We owe $19 trillion. We can’t.
So the establishment is not ever probably – look, you know what? In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they’ll be saying "Okay, it’s a good thing" because they’ll be beneficiaries also.
But we do have a real establishment and they’ve never seen this happen before.
A writer called up and he said recently – I told this story. I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond. And he said, "Mr. Trump, how does it feel?" I said, "How does what feel?" "How does it feel? What you’ve done has never, ever been done before?" I said, "What have I done?" "You’ve dominated the Summer of Trump." Now they call it the Autumn of Trump.
Hopefully, they’re going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump.
But I said to the writer, "I don’t know what you’re talking about. I haven’t done anything ‘cause frankly if I don’t win I consider this to be a total waste of time." I’ll be honest with you. As much as I like being with you tonight. Because we won’t be able to do anything.
He said, "No, no. You’ve won even if you don’t win. You’ve won already." I said, "No, you’re wrong. If I don’t win, I have wasted my time."
So you know, the point is that the establishment can’t believe it because they’ve never seen it happen before.
...I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year. Everybody – even my enemies – said "Trump is going to win." I said, "I won’t win." They said, "Why?" "I won’t win. Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years. I was nominated. I should have." And I said, "I’ll never win." I told everybody I’ll never win because I’m not Hollywood establishment.
And with Time Magazine, I said – Bill O’Reilly, who’s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won.
Now, I’m not saying I should have – yeah, I probably should have in all fairness – but he said "Nobody’s done more" – you know, taking over – what we’ve done has been amazing – all of us together not just me. It’s all of us. It’s all of us. From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma. All of us. Because the spirit.
...Well, Merkel got it. Now, Merkel, what did she do? She’s destroyed – I mean, she’s in the process of destroying Germany with the migration.
We have to help the people with the migration. We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria. But I don’t want them coming into this country. I don’t want them because we don’t know who they are. We don’t know who they are. Them with their printing press that now do the forged passports. Okay? You heard about that. So we don’t know.
The bottom line on that – it’s such an interesting question. You’ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly.
But the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think it’s over. I said before. Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing. People are amazing. You would love the people. They would love you. You’d love everybody. The whole country is in love...I call it the noisy majority. It’s no longer a silent majority. It’s the noisy majority.
But if we win like I think we’re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it’s not going to matter. They can’t do anything. I don’t care about the establishment. They can’t do anything.
You know, the only way they can do is if I’m a little bit short, if I’m two votes short I have a problem because I’ll have to go into that convention, I’m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they’ll make their deals and they’ll have all their money guys around and they’ll be in the backroom making deals.
But if I get the number of delegates, there’s not a thing they can do. And I’ll end up doing fine with the establishment...


...I’m such a believer in education.
You know, I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT who was a brilliant guy...In fact, I just retweeted an article about him today. You’ve got to read it. Okay? @RealDonaldTrump. You have to read it.
When I see somebody like Jeb – no I’ll tell you one thing I respect. He didn’t change his views. He knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn’t change. And I respect that to a certain extent. But it’s so wrong.
Common Core is a total disaster. We have people – bureaucrats in Washington – telling you how your child should be educated in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the different places that we go to. It’s ridiculous.
And I go around and I’ve seen the principals. I’ve seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and I’ve seen some of the people and the love – even in Iowa at a school – I’ve seen some of the love these parents give to those schools. This is real love. These are smart people. And these are people that aren’t working for a paycheck. These are incredible people...
Remember this: Our educational system is a mess. We spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we’re in 28th place. And I mean like double what anybody else pays.
So I want to bring education back to the local areas. You’re going to have parents and you’re going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it’s so important. And you’re going to be very happy with it. Okay? Thank you. Thank you.


...You people do it. We’re backing you 100%...We are backing you 100%. You’re doing a phenomenal job. There should be more people like you in this country.
You know, the whole grid is a disaster. Right? The whole country. The infrastructure of our country is falling apart.
And nobody can build like me. It’s what I do. I build. I build.
I’m building on – as you know – Pennsylvania Avenue a big tremendous hotel that I got from the government of the United States. Can you believe it? During the Obama administration a couple of years ago.
But we had the best plan. The GSA is terrific. They’re very good. Actually, they’re very talented people.
We’re under-budget and ahead of schedule. That’s what we do.
When you see these things where they’re building a bridge and it’s going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion. How about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion?
And I look at it – I’m very good – I can look at a building and tell you how much it’s going to cost.
I say "$250 million." "No, sir, $3 billion." $3 billion? Think somebody got rich on that one?
So we’re going to stop all this stuff. We’re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful. And we all love it anyways. We love it.
But it’s so sad to see what’s happening. It’s so sad. And we’re going to change it around.


...We have such a problem. And the biggest problem I have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you’d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they’re going through nice colleges, they’re good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, "Mr. Trump, we have no jobs. We can’t get jobs."
So they’re borrowed up to the hilt and they can’t get jobs.
We’re going to bring our jobs back from China. We’re going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.
We’re going to bring our jobs back from South America. We’re bringing them back from Mexico. We’re going to have jobs again. Believe me. We’re going to be manufacturers again.
We’re going to start making Apple computers in this country. What the hell good does it do to make them in China? I want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.
So, we’re going to bring our jobs back. Okay?


Wow! Thank you very much.
Hello.
I’d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and California. We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in. Very big numbers.
I’m truly honored by your support.
Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is. We’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful. Remember that.
Tonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history. No matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.
This is a great feeling. That’s a great feeling.
This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.
You’ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.
We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it, folks. We’re going to do it.
I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down. Too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears. I’m never going to let you down.
I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is – it’s a movement.
Now, recent polls have shown that I’m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.
To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you. I want to thank you very, very much.
To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.
To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.


And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against – and he’s right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible. And that’s what I do.
We are going to have fantastic trade deals. We’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
Now, I know some people say I’m too much of a fighter. My preference is always peace, however. And I’ve shown that. I’ve shown that for a long time.
I’ve built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved – always.
My goal is always again to bring people together. But I’m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
I’ve fought for my family. I’ve fought for my business. I’ve fought for my employees. And now I’m going to fight for you – the American people – like nobody has ever fought before.
And I’m not a politician fighting. I’m me. You’re going to see some real good things happen.
Just remember this: I’m going to be your champion. I’m going to be America’s champion.
Because, you see, this election isn’t about Republican or Democrat. It’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people – and I mean the American people.
Every election year politicians promised change. Obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well. And every year, they failed to deliver.
Why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? That’s what they’re doing, folks.
Why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very, very wealthy?
I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support – the only way you could have done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.


After years of disappointment, there’s one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very – and I mean this so, so strongly – on the very people who rigged it. And they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.
We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something that how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands. Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her. Not right.
I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.
I wonder if the press would want to attend. Who knows?
Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into a private hedge fund. The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.
It’s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
I didn’t need to do this. It’s not easy. Believe me. I didn’t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family.


I’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s lives.
I’ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs – they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared. An embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible.
I’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration – moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country. Remember it, folks. Remember it.
I’ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.
I’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and I’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours. It’s really not to be believed. Hard to imagine what’s happened to our country.
America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.
We’re broke. We’re broke. We owe $19 trillion. Going quickly to $21 trillion.
Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared.
The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.
What a crowd. What a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country. We love our country.
But we can turn this all around. We’re going to do it by putting America first.
That commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time.


It’s important to understand what America First means.
It means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation.
This is the opposite of Hillary’s foreign policy, which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East. And they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way.
Better hope I’m president.
On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition – what’s happening here is absolutely a disgrace.
No PPP [sic]. You’re right about that. So and you mean no PP.
We are going – and remember this – we are only going to have great trade deals. Okay? We are only going to have that.
We’re not going to approve as somebody just said the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a disaster – a disaster – for our country. Almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular Mexico.
If it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering big league and it’s getting worse.
On energy policy, America First means opening up America’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.
On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses. Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers. Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies.


The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges. It’s got to be that way.
Now, the people in charge say things can’t change. I’m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change.
We’re going to put America back to work. We’re going to make our own products. We’re going to put America back to work.
We’re going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our African-American people that have been mistreated for so long.
We’re going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous. Prosperous again.
Together, we will put the American people first again. First again.
We will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again! Remember. Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you very much everybody!


Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This has been a great period of time. It’s been really amazing.
We’ve gotten the nomination. We’re going to have an incredible period in Cleveland. We look forward to it.
We’ve started working already on the convention.
And LeBron, good luck in the series because we’re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that’s okay. And it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens.
But as you know, they’re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting. It’ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that’s good. That’s what we want because it’s going to be an exciting period of time.
We have – we’ve done some awfully good work. I was just informed...that we’ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go.
And in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we’ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions – by many millions more – than anybody who’s ever run.
So that’s a great. You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. So that’s something to me that’s very exciting.
And overall, it’s just been a very exciting process. I think we’re going to do very well.
We have no idea what’s going to happen on the Democrat’s side but they’re certainly having difficulty. I don’t like to see people having difficulty. But if anybody has to have it, let it be them.
And I think it’s going to be very interesting.
I’m very proud to say that we’ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that’s also a record. So we’ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters.
Our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. We’re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary. And I think we’re going to have a very, very successful number of months. And I think it will all culminate in November and we’re going to make America great. Okay?
So that’s the way it is...






I’m glad you asked the question because I have to tell you I have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets – almost $6 million. And more money is going to come in I believe over the next little while too.
But I’ve raised almost $6 million. All of the money has been paid out and I’m going to give it to you in just a second.
In fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked.
But the money has been paid out.
I have been thanked by so many veterans’ groups throughout the United States.
One gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000. I have been thanked by so many groups – great veterans’ groups.
And by the way, outside you have a few people picketing. They’re sent there by Hillary Clinton and they’re picketing that the money wasn’t sent. The money has all been sent.
I wanted to keep it private. If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don’t think it’s anybody’s business if I want to send money to the vets.
But I have to say this. I raised close to $6 million. It’ll probably be over that amount when it’s all said and done. But as of this moment, it’s $5.6 million.
When this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said let’s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million. And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that.




But I will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves.
And behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves. They are calling me. They are furious because I sent people checks of a lot of money.
We’re going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.
And instead of being like "Thank you very much, Mr. Trump" or "Trump did a good job", everyone said, "Who got it? Who got it? Who got it?" And you make me look very bad.
I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.
So I will give the names because that’s what you want. Right?
Okay. Are you ready?
I brought them here. It takes – because you have to vet each company. You know, much of this money was paid out fairly early.
But you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups. You have to go through a process. When you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you’ve never heard of – charitable organizations. You have to vet it. You send people out. You do a lot of work.
Now, most of the money went out quite a while ago. Some of it went out more recently. But all of this has gone out and I’ll give you the names.
Are you ready? Do you have your pad?
And again, I really think the press – look, the media, you know my opinion of the media. It’s very low. I think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people. But I think this is an example.
And I just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; I gave $1 million, but I just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did.
One other thing that’s important to know. Zero dollars have been taken out for administration.
You know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration. So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff. So no money – it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money. Okay?
So you have 22 Kill and that’s $200,000.
And you can call these people. That was another thing. A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call. I could tell you, I’m not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting. They’d call and these vet groups they don’t get a lot of calls from the press. And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn’t know or they didn’t want to talk to the press or they didn’t feel comfortable.
So if they didn’t say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money. All certified checks. If anyone wants to see the certified checks.
But rather than say why don’t you – could I see a certified check? They said "Well, they didn’t say they got the money." They all got the money.
But they’re not people that always talk to the press. Many of them do talk to the press. Many of them have – I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked.
Well, the number is $5.6 million and it’s going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in.
Ready?
22Kill got $200,000.
Now, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets.
Achilles International – great organization – $200,000. Much of this money was paid a long time ago.
American Hero Adventures – $100,000.
Americans for Equal Living – $100,000.
America’s Vetdogs – The Veterans’ K-9 Corps Inc. – $75,000.
AMVETS – $75,000.


Just so you understand. When I didn’t do the Fox debate...because I didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox. But when I didn’t do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech. I didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea.
And I had some very generous people – Carl Icahn gave $500,000. Phil Ruffin gave $1 million...Ike Perlmutter gave $1 million. We raised a lot of money. And I didn’t have to do that. It would have been easier just to give the speech.
And the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because it’s a lot easier actually that way.


And I believe we’re going to have some more coming in. Some friends of mine, some more coming in. And that adds up to $5,600,000 total and we’re going to have some more coming in.
Now, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they’re getting a final approval from the government. But every one of those has been passed.
This is my check for $1 million.
We have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn’t ask – I didn’t ask people to be here today. I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say "Donald Trump didn’t give the money."
Nobody gave this kind of money.
So I gave $5,600,000. More is coming in. Probably tops the $6 million number.
I never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started. And we end up doing almost $6 million.
I have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair.
A lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money. And I just want to thank all of those people.






I wasn’t too involved in picking the organizations other than to the Marine Law Enforcement. They are fabulous people. They honored me last year at the Waldorf Astoria. I knew them.
I was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn’t vet them quickly. And so I gave it to the Marine.
And if you look at number, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation is a fabulous group and I didn’t have to go through a big vetting process with them. Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didn’t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups.






Because I wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart. I didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going "Where did it go? Who did it go to?" Then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it.
...Look, when this started...I said if we could raise $1 million that would be good. And we ended up raising almost $6 million. And I’m going to have more coming in over a period of time.






I’m totally accountable but I didn’t want to have credit for it.
Actually though what I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me. And this is money. And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand. But a lot of these groups – getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation. They need a lot of different things.


Plus, we want to find out who’s in the good group.
I had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money.
We have given to groups that are unbelievable groups. And honestly, I wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters. They are so happy. And I’m happy to do it. I didn’t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly.






Well, generally speaking, that’s 100% true.






I like scrutiny. But you know what? When I raise money – excuse me, excuse me, I’ve watched you on television. You’re a real beauty. When I raise money for the veterans and it’s a massive amount of money – find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans – nothing.
And then I see a few guys standing out there. They don’t even know what they’re there for. They have no idea. They’re there because Hillary Clinton’s campaign sent them.
And actually I think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which was interesting but I wasn’t surprised.
I don’t want the credit for it but I shouldn’t be lambasted.
And remember this: So out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did I take for administration cost. That’s unheard of.






How else am I going to raise the money? How else am I going to raise the money?






I would have given – just so you understand. Until I was criticized – so I’m the only one in the world that could raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans’ groups, and end up being criticized by the press.
Yes, I made a speech and during the speech I said, "Let’s raise a little money for the vets." It turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money. I thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been.






That’s right. I do raise millions.






No, I don’t think so.






No, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn’t come through. But more money is coming through than didn’t come through. The number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million.






I don’t mind it coming from the opposition...What I do mind is when I raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $5 million or close to $6 [million].






So, look, here’s the story. Here’s the story. I think and I’ve been dealing with the press a long time. I think the political press is among the most dishonest people I’ve ever met, I have to tell you that. Okay?
...But I think the political press...I think the political press – I see the stories and I see the way they’re attached.
For instance, I went down this weekend to do Rolling Thunder. I was invited. I didn’t have anything to do with it. We had a tremendous gathering of people – thousands – I don’t know how many thousands – but many thousands of people. And I joked "Oh, I thought we were going to go from the Jefferson Memorial to the – " I was joking. They said "Donald Trump was disappointed". Everybody knew I was being sarcastic and joking. They said some of them. Said Donald Trump was very disappointed that it didn’t go from Jefferson to Lincoln. You know, millions of people.
I was joking. I said "Oh, I’m used to watching it. We had – " I was joking. So they put it down as serious. They know I was joking.
I’ll give you another example. We had a certain – same event – it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people. I don’t know – 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000. I don’t know there was a lot of people. Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along.
Eugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there. There were many times that. And you weren’t allowed to have any more people.
And all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way. They were waving to me as I’m going.


But wait a minute. The point is law enforcement – these people didn’t allow you to have any more people.
...I had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had. It was all cordoned off. You weren’t allowed to have any more. You weren’t allowed to have any more people than that.
So instead of saying Trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said "Trump was disappointed" because I didn’t have millions of people going from Jefferson to Washington. I mean, give me a break.
...Honestly, it’s dishonest reporting.






Well, the veterans believe me. Let me tell you, the veterans why they believe. And I have group that I gave...[invites a veteran to speak]
...I could have asked all these groups – he just showed up. I just saw him. But I could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made – I didn’t want to do that.
I’m not looking for credit. But what I don’t want is when I raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from ABC – he’s a sleaze in my book. You’re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.
Veteran:
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
First of all for the record, I’m a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant.
What I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he’s concerned about veterans. That’s Donald Trump. I met him over a year ago.
I’ve been involved in many fundraisers. There are many scammers out there. He did the right thing by vetting these groups there.
If you look at some of the groups, they’re given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they’re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips. He gave 100%.
The liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation. All right? I’m a former chairman. I’ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist.
Stop using veterans as a political pawns. You’ve got a guy outside...go do a Google search on his Facebook. He’s out there. His pictures with Clinton.
They are using veterans as political pawns. It must stop.
Donald Trump is doing this with a heart. You’re all focused on the way he’s raising money and you’re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday. You’re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists.
Look at his plans on his Trump website. He talks about medical cards. He talks about fixing the VA. He talks about competition.
I think the liberal media and I’ve been dealing with you a long time. You need to get your head out of your butt. Focus on the real issues.
Thank you.


What I did – I didn’t ask Al. I’ve gotten to know Al a little bit primarily through New Hampshire where we had great victories. But he showed up this morning because he was upset.
And many of the other groups were upset. They received $100,000 in the mail. They didn’t even know what it was for. It was from me. Other groups received $200,000, $250,000. They didn’t know what it was for.
And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying. I have received letters – heartfelt letters.
...The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore. Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I’ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that.
So we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans.
And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don’t know the extent. They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn’t make, you know, didn’t raise this kind of money.
But we raised a lot and I’ll be raising more and we’ll be sending it to other people as we get along.






It’s a complicated process.






No, it doesn’t...You know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons. So it really does – and more than anything else, it’s also speaking to other veterans. We have a circle of veterans. I don’t want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn’t do good work. So it’s called vetting. We vet the vets. But it’s called vetting.






I think it’s bothersome because I love the vets and I’ve worked hard for the vets. And as you can see, I’ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets.
And I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest. So I don’t like that. I don’t like dishonesty.






Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man. Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate.
Jeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement.
You know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he’s been in the Senate.
So you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider. Absolutely. He’s a fantastic person.






I think it was a very tough call. It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby – looks so beautiful and calm. And there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous. I don’t think they had a choice. I mean, probably they didn’t have a choice.
You have a child, a young child, at stake. You know, it’s too bad there wasn’t another way.
I thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy. But it just takes one second. It’s one second – it’s not like it takes place over – well, he’s going to do it 30 seconds from now. It just takes one little flick of his finger. And I will tell you they probably had no choice.
...




I’m entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country what’s going on.
You look at what’s happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where they’re catching people stealing and they don’t even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They’re dying while they wait on line.
And I am in favor of if they can’t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they’re going to see a doctor and the country’s going to pay for it. They’re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We’re losing thousands of people waiting on line.
And the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he’s running our country.
You look at the TSA, you look at what’s going on at the airports and you look at that. Okay? Just take a look at that. That’s like the Veterans Administration.
Nothing in our country works anymore. It’s a mess.
And maybe that’s why I’m doing so well in the polls.






No, it doesn’t have to be privatization. No, it doesn’t have to be privatization. What it has to be is when somebody’s on line and they say it’s going to be a seven day wait, that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of. We’re going to pay the bill.
And by the way, that’s going to be a lot less expensive. And we’ll check it out and be careful. But that’s going to be a lot less expensive than what’s going on.
These people are living in hell.
And Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine. And the head of it, [Bob] McDonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad – look at Disney World. Okay? These are the kind of people we have running things. It’s ridiculous.






...That’s their choice. You have a party called the Democrats and they’re going to have to make that choice. I think it’s probably going to be her because it’s rigged.
And I think if you people will say I’m the one that came up with the term "rigged". I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides. With the Republicans it’s less obvious. With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it’s ridiculous.
So I think that they’re going to have to make that determination.
If you’re asking me who I prefer running against?






I think what she did was very bad and I think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed.




The judge has been very unfair. Has not done a good job. He’s been a very bad judge. Has been very unfair. And I will win the Trump University case. I already am as far as I’m concerned. But I will win the Trump University case.
Because I don’t care...
I have a judge who’s very, very unfair.
Well, you’ll see it in court documents. But I have a judge who’s very, very unfair. He knows he’s unfair. And I’ll win the Trump University case. I can settle that case. I could have settled it. I just choose not to.
In fact, when I ran this, they said why didn’t you settle up that case? I don’t want to settle the case.
Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle. And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially. It was good. It was great.
And you know what? When they’re on the stand and you say "How come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good? How come you signed the letter?"
The woman that was the original plaintiff in the case – they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case. The case should have been dropped. The whole case should have been dropped.
They wanted her dismissed from the case. You know why? Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we’d win the case easily. She signed a letter and she’s on film. She’s on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University. So they didn’t want her anymore because she’s a disaster for them.
So they went to the judge and they said "Your honor, we’d like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case." And he said, "Oh, that’s okay." She’s the one that started the case.
Now, they don’t even want her to testify. They don’t want her to testify because she’s a disaster. She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it. And importantly, she’s on tape saying how great it is. They don’t want her. I wouldn’t want her either.
Now, I could have settled that case. I could settle that case. I can settle that case. I don’t want to. I’ll go through the process.






Because we’re down the line. Because we’re down the line and the fact that you can’t win as independent. For the most part, you can’t even get on Texas and various other states now. It’s too late. But Texas is out.
...Here’s what happens. What happens is you will not have – and very importantly – you will not have Supreme Court justices. You’re going to lose. You could have as many as four or five. That’s over.
Now, [Bill] Kristol’s the one that’s – but he’s the last one. Don’t forget, he said "Trump will never run." The guy’s not a smart person. He said, "Donald Trump would never run." Remember?
You remember? I actually blame you. Why do you put this guy on television? I see him on the different shows. He’s got no credibility. Said I won’t run. If I run, I won’t do well. If I do well, this and that. He looks like such a fool.
I saw him on one show. He’s practically crying because he can’t justify.
Now he comes out with a tweet over the weekend – over Memorial Day weekend – it sounds like he’s going to put somebody up. Even I thought it. I thought, "Oh, they’re going to find indie."
Now he comes out with something saying he was almost – almost – kidding. Okay?
Let me tell you, these people are losers. He’s trying to make you – he’s trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts.
If they do an indie, assuming it’s decent, which I don’t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they’d look like fools. But what you’re going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover. It will never, ever be the same.






No, I didn’t say that. I said Bill Kristol is a loser and I’ll tell you why...He has called every single move. Take a look – on me, he’s going to lose this state – I won in a landslide...I didn’t say everybody. Many. I didn’t say everybody.
Wait, wait, wait. Bill Kristol is a loser. His magazine is failing, as you know. It’s going to be down – I don’t think it even survives. He’s getting some free publicity.
But Bill Kristol – I’ve been watching this for two years. "Trump isn’t going to run." Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire. "Oh, he’s not going to win New Hampshire." I win in a landslide. Every place I went I was not going to win. But I win in a landslide. Do you think maybe he doesn’t like me?






It’s wrong. It’s wrong. I didn’t get 30%.






My last score was 78%. I didn’t get 30%.






I don’t know. No, no, no.
Here’s the way I look at it.
When I have somebody that’s not on my side, when you know – by the way, I’ve gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the Republican Party is really well unified.
We have come up. People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, "I support Trump." So remember that. We don’t talk about that too much.
But actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process. It was a rough – that was a rough campaign...
I can this. The real is how fast we’re getting together.
Now, if I have a Republican who’s not on my side, I’m not going to be – why should I be particularly nice to that person? I’m not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie. But you know what? Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person that’s not going to support me? I have no obligation.
Politically, I may be right. I may be wrong. But that’s who I am. I’m a very honest person...
If somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back. Not always. But I may choose to hit them back.






I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney lost an election he should have won.
And if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool.
Look, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Just so you understand. I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney. I made robocalls for Mitt Romney. I made speeches for him. He let us down.
If you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool.
Now, what would I say good about Mitt Romney?






She was not nice and I was fine, just a little bit of a jab. But she wasn’t nice. And you think I’m going to change? I’m not changing, including with her.






Bob Dole is a fan of mine. Bob Dole endorsed me. So don’t tell me about Bob Dole.






Well, look, Gary Johnson, he got 1% of the vote last time. I watched that whole situation. It was pretty disgraceful. I think it’s a total fringe deal. I think he’s a fringe candidate if you want to know the truth. I look at him and I watch him and I watch his motions and I watch what he says. I think that he is a fringe candidate...when you do a little research on that I think it’s not going to be a factor. Okay?






No, not all of you. Just many of you.






Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Let me tell you something. I’m a person – yeah, it’s going to be like this...If the press writes false stories like they did with this – half of you were amazed that I raised all of this money. If the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile. I didn’t want the credit for raising all this money for the vets. I wasn’t looking for the credit.
And by the way, more money is coming in. I wasn’t looking for the credit.
But I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn’t raise any money for them.
Not only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago. And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that.
But when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in. But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in. And this is going to phenomenal groups.
And I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard. And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, I’m going to continue to attack the press.
Look, I find the press to be extremely dishonest. I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest. I will say that.
Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.


Well, thank you very much everyone.
I want to start by, as always, thanking my family. My wife, Melania. My kids – they’re not kids anymore but they’re kids as far as I’m concerned. They’ll always be my kids. And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us. I want to thank my entire family, including Maryanne, Elizabeth, Robert.
And it’s been some unbelievable day and evening and year. I never have been through anything like this but it’s a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and we’re going to make America great again. We’re going to make America great again.
So important – so important that the people of Indiana have been incredible.
I started as you know not very long ago – about six weeks ago – and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit.
And I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people – incredible people. You don’t get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger. And toward the end, it was like I didn’t want to leave. I almost said, "Maybe I’ll just never leave" and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight.
It was a tremendous victory.
And I have to thank Bobby Knight. Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible. He was incredible.
I always that people like that – there aren’t many – but it’s called tough, smart, and they know how to win. And that’s what our country needs. We have to win again. We have to know how to win.
And we haven’t won. We’ve been losing all the time. We lose with our military. We can’t beat ISIS. We lose with trade. We lose with borders. We lose everything.
We’re not going to lose. We’re going to start winning again and we’re going to win big league. Believe me.
So when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates.


And I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another.
And I called my people and I said, "How can we win? It’s just constantly." It was the same as in Florida. You know, there’ve been 60,000 negative ads.
I got it right from you folks, okay? 60,000. In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000. Now it’s 60,000 negative ads – most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. And I said how can anybody endure this?
I had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching. And I said that’s just incredible.
And the people are so smart. They don’t buy it. They get it.
And it’s tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent – millions and millions of dollars. And they were comparing it. They think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000. So, I mean, to me that’s the way it’s supposed to be. That’s something that makes me feel really, really very good.
And now we’re going to Nebraska where I have – I just hear we’re doing really wonderfully. I look forward to that very much.
And West Virginia. And we’re going to get those miners back to work. I’ll tell you what. We’re going to get those miners back to work.
We’re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again.
Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they’re going to start to work again. Believe me. You’re going to be proud again to be miners.
So we’ll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we’ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%. And don’t forget, that’s with three people. So 62% with two people is a massive landslide. But 63% almost – just a little over 62% – when you have that kind of a number with three people, it’s actually unheard of.
And all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it’s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers. And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people. I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York. But we never got the credit for that.
But now we don’t need the credit because we’re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president.
She doesn’t understand trade. Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done. It’s called NAFTA.
And I was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially. Now I’ve known Syracuse and I’ve known Poughkeepsie and I’ve known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible.


And all of the different state – Connecticut. And I’ve witnessed what it’s done really firsthand. And it has been indeed carnage.
And we’re going to change it around.
We’re not going to let Carrier and all of these companies just think they can move – go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing: We get unemployment. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore.
We’re going to bring back our jobs and we’re going to keep our jobs. We’re not going to let companies leave.
Now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete.
But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that’s not going to happen. Not going to happen.
And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences.
I have to tell you that I’ve competed all my life. Competitive person. All my life I’ve been in competitions. Different competitions whether it’s sports or business or now for 10 months politics.
And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party.
You know, we started off with that 17 number. And just so you understand – Ted Cruz – I don’t know if he likes me or if he doesn’t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy.
And he has got an amazing future. He’s got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted.
And I know how tough it is. It’s tough. It’s tough.
I’ve had some moments where it’s not looking so good, and it’s not a great feeling. And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family.
And I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others. I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me. Incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first. He just called me and said, "It’s a movement you’ve got going. We’ve got to do something because I’ll tell you what, it’s an incredible movement." And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we’re going to win. We’re going to win in November.
And we’re going to win big and it’s going to be America first.
You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we’re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don’t respect us and they don’t take care of us and they don’t treat us right in many cases.
And that’s not going to happen.
Now, we’re going to keep things going and we’re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe – soon – $21 trillion. It’s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion.
And we’re just not in a position that we’re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.


So, we’re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries.
But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we’ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers.
So that will change. And I will tell you, they’re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They’re going to respect us.
In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic.
We have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we’re coming from.
And you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we’re going down one side and they’re coming up the other. And we’re going to meet and we are going to have something that’s going to be really fabulous.
Now, if that can’t happen. If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it’s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we’re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East.
And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country.
We’ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it’s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you’ve never seen.
So I have to say that we are going to turn it around.
We’re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It’s the cheapest thing we can do. And we’re going to have to take out ISIS and we’re going to have to take them out fast. We can’t allow that cancer to continue. We cannot allow it to continue.
And you know, one group that’s been so incredible to me are the vets – the veterans. And they’ve been treated so badly. So badly. And we’re going to get that straightened out.
Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it’s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I’m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things...
And that’s going to continue because they’re not going to be able to do it, folks.
They’re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals.
They’re not going to be able to do what we do with the military.
They’re not going to be able to do what we’re going to do on the border, including the wall.
We’re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what’s going on. They want jobs.
And we’re going to bring back our jobs. We’re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again.
And this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country. And we’re going to love each other. We’re going to cherish each other. We’re going to take care of each other. And we’re going to have great economic development.
And we’re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that’s what’s been happening for far too many years and we’re not going to do it anymore. We’re not going to do it anymore.
I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He’s doing a tremendous job. It’s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he’s down to one.


I don’t know. Is there a second? I mean, is there a second? I don’t know.
But I have ask you folks to explain the status of that.
But he’s done an amazing job and I think we’re going to see something really, really fantastic.
I also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope. I mean, these people. What we’ve been doing has been incredible.
The work has been unreal.
And Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka. I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I’m excited. And he’s very good at politics.
So again folks this has been an amazing evening. I didn’t expect this. I didn’t expect it.
And what Ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party. We have to bring unity. It’s so much easier if we have it.
And many, many people are calling that you wouldn’t even believe – the media, the press, they wouldn’t believe. People who have said the worst things about me – I’ve never had things said about me like this.
You know, with my businesses, I’ve always been very respected. People didn’t talk to me this way. But in politics, it’s easy.
The worst things and they’re calling now and they’re calling us all and they’re saying, "We’d love to get on the train" – the "Trump Train" they call it – "But we’d love to get on the team."
And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, "I’d love having you and I think it’s terrific. But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?" And he said, "Mr. Trump, don’t even think about it. Don’t worry about it. There’ll be no problem." In other words, he’s a politician; there’s no problem. I would have had a hard time.
But we have a lot of people coming – lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions – Sen. Jeff Sessions – one of the most respected men or people in Congress.
And so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible.
Jerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something. He is really a special person. They’ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty. We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it. But he’s a special guy and he really has helped. And so many pastors and ministers.
And tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals. The evangelical vote was for Trump.
And there’s no greater honor. No greater honor. We’re going to work together for many, many years. We’re going to make it so good. We’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. We’re going to be saying it...
And I won with women. I love winning with women. But I won with women. I won with men. We won with Hispanics. We won with African-Americans. We won with every – virtually every category. So it’s just been an amazing evening.
So again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. I want to thank my wife and my family. It’s an incredible family.
I want to thank my staff – both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we’re doing currently, my staff where we’re running for the presidency.
And remember this. Our theme is very simple. It’s make America great. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.
Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you! Thank you very much!


So beautiful. She said, "Do you mind? I wrote something – coming out, I wrote something. Do you mind if I said it?" I said, "Not at all. Should I read it?" She said, "I don’t want you to read it. I don’t want you to read it."
Thank you very much. I want to thank Melania for that. That was very special.
You know, Wisconsin’s a really special place, and we’ve been all over today. Speeches all over. We had one before. Thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed. And we had another one in the morning, and it’s been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results.
You see what’s happening with the polls. Boom! Like a rocket ship. It’s like a rocket.
I guess I just heard when I walked in one just came out that we’re 10 points up. But don’t worry about that. Pretend you didn’t hear that. Go out and vote tomorrow. Okay? Go out and vote tomorrow.
You know, I always tell – I used to say this to politicians that run that’d be friends of mine, I’d say, "Pretend you’re a little bit behind. Okay? That way you’d work hard. You’d never forget."
But you know, there’s somebody that was – I saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and Melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully. And some of you know who she is. Many of you know who she is.
But she was Miss Wisconsin. She has one of the most incredible spirits that I’ve ever seen. She’s got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine.


I’ll tell you that’s an amazing and just an incredible story and we’re going to make sure that it goes as well as it can.
She was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart.
And you noticed no teleprompters? We don’t have teleprompters. We want to do it right from here and from here and from here.
But I just want to – I saw Melissa, and I said, "I have to have you up" because her story’s an amazing story and it’s a story of courage and we’re going to work with her family and we’re going to make sure everything goes well.
Okay, thank you all very much.
So, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks I’ve got to explain what’s happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin.
This Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. Cruz is pushing it hard.
Kasich, I don’t think he’s a player here. I mean, the guy is one in 32. He’s one and it was in his own state. And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio. He’s one and 32.
Now, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that. Many people were doing better. It’s called you get out. He’s taking my votes. We have to get over 50%. And how do you do that?
Look, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, "I’m one in 32. In other words, I’ve won one out of 32 states," and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out.


And she’s going through a very hard time. And she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we’re all – what we’re trying to do. Not me. I’m a messenger. What we’re trying to do – make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we don’t win anymore.
We don’t win anymore. We don’t win with trade. We don’t win with the military.
We pay for everybody else’s military.
We don’t know what we’re doing.
And she saw it and she was here early. And she knows that we’re going to take care of our people, and it’s going to be America first. It’s got to be America first. We have no choice. We have no choice.
And she’s with a friend of hers who’s very well-known, Chelsea Cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person. Also a great singer but I won’t even mention that because Chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that. Chelsea is such a great friend of Melissa Young and Melissa Young – I just want to bring her and Chelsea onto the stage and maybe Melissa would like to say something and Chelsea. But this is just an unbelievable woman.
So could I ask Melissa to come up on stage please?


And by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say "I want to run" and you go to the convention and you run.
But it would be nice to see – because I’ll tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does Cruz. And I don’t like it. I don’t think it’s right. I don’t think it’s appropriate.
But you know what? If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily. Okay, folks? I mean, okay?
But Kasich voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country.
Ted Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts. What they’re doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we can’t talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement. He wouldn’t let them do it. He’s the one that fought currency devaluation. That’s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs. And we can’t let this go on any longer.
Now, they’re controlled by their PACs. They’re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions. They’re controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington. They have signs on their forehead. It’s like stamped into their forehead – "I take care of Cruz." They’re specialists. "I take care of Kasich." "I take care of Hillary."
Oh, Hillary. Ayeyeye. "Take care of Hillary."
So we can’t let it happen anymore. We can’t let it happen anymore.
It’s time – you know Obama used to say, "Time for change"? I’ll say it’s time for change but real change this time not that change. Real change.
Obama yesterday – President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal. I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed. The ink isn’t even dry and now he’s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it’s only going to get worse.
And by the way, Iran is getting worse. They were supposed to come into the community. Remember? What a bunch of babies. Are we babies? Are we babies? Hello over there.
They were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved.
Now, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets. Those are the big jets. 100. They didn’t order Boeing.
The reason – one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending. So we give them $150 billion and they’re not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products. Okay? How crazy are we? How much longer is it going to last? When are we going to get smart? When are we going to stop?
We as a country are being ripped off. We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world. Okay? Whether it’s militarily or trade.
We don’t win anymore. We can’t win with the military. We can’t beat ISIS.
Can you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton? They say get rid of ISIS. What do you think?
...It’s so sad to see what’s happening to our country and we’re going to turn it around and we’re going to change it. And we’re going to make it rich again, and we’re going to make it strong again.
So, and so many different elements, and I’ve been talking about trade. I always talk about trade.
Because when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras; I’ve never seen anything like it. So many cameras. And I took a deep breadth and I said, "Let’s go." Because we have to do it.
You know, it takes guts. Running for president, believe me, takes guts. It takes a lot of guts. Believe me.
And even for the politicians they run at least they’re out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty. You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that I’m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat. What kind of stuff is that?
And somebody said, "Well, there’s a rule and another rule." I don’t care about rules, folks. I go out and I campaign. We win. We win. We get the delegates. Right?
But in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz. We’ve beaten him in most of the states. I mean, we’re just winning so much. And we’re winning by almost 300 delegates.
So we’re doing great. And I think we close it out before the convention. I think we actually close it out before the convention.


And that’s like a prizefighter. You know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in. And they say, "What do you think? You may have an unfriendly decision." He says, "No, when you knock them out, there’s no unfriendly decision."
If we get the delegates, we’ve pulled out a knock-out. And that’s the way it’s going to be, and I can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board.
Frankly, when I looked at what happened – a friend of mine, who’s a great – you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down – not very far from here. And he said, "With Wisconsin, you’re going win." I said, "Well, what do you think? But I’m not seeing polls that are great. I’m a little bit down. I’m down in some. I’m a little bit down." He says, "No, no, you’re going to win. But you have to be there. You have to come in and you have to talk to the people." Like we did this afternoon at the hangar. And he said, "You’re going to win. I mean, you’re going to win." He’s a very smart guy, I want to tell you. Great guy. But he said, "You’ve got to come in."
We’ve been making – I’ve been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day. We’re here constantly. You’re going to get so sick of me. You’re going to say, "Oh, get him the hell out of here."
No, we are making so much progress and it’s been so inspiring to see the people. I mean, look at even you people. You don’t sit down. If you want, you can. Oh, stay up. Stand up. What the heck? Hey, we’ve got plenty of time to sit down, right? We’ve got plenty of time.
But I do appreciate that. That’s a sign of affection, and it’s a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it. That’s really nice.
So we have to bring our country back and so many different things.
With China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year.
With Mexico, we will build a wall. We will have strong borders. Strong borders. Believe me. We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year. The wall’s going to cost $10 billion to build. And people, the politicians are saying, "How can you possibly get them to pay?"
Let me tell you something, folks. We have some good business people in this audience.
When you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that’s real easy. And that’s on a yearly basis the $58 billion. It’s really easy.
And they don’t understand it. They said, "How are you going to get them to pay?"
I said, "It’s so easy." And you understand it. Just rely on me. Okay? Rely. So easy. That’s so easy. And we’re going to have a strong border.
You know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they’re told to stand back but they don’t want to stand back. They want to do their job properly. They’re proud people. They’re incredible people. Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we’re building it anyway. Okay? We’re building it. Believe me.
But the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago. And I didn’t ask for it. I didn’t know.
First time, first time they’ve ever done it. Right? First time, they’ve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement. And it’s so important.
Now, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona. You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it.
Look, we have to have strong borders. We can’t let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they’re coming from. We don’t know if they’re Syrians.
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. Who knows?
I have as big a heart as anybody. We want to help them. We want to build safe zones in Syria.
I want to get the Gulf States to pay for it. The Gulf States have nothing but money. We don’t have money. We will run it. We will do a good job. We’ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change. We can’t do it.
...I keep getting these requests. You know, Al Green – the great Al Green wrote "The Snake". How many people have heard "The Snake"? How many people? Oh, do you want to hear "The Snake"? Do you want to hear it? I mean, people love it and I love it because it says what’s going to happen to us if we’re not careful.
And this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going – we’re going to have problems. We’re going to have huge problems. Allowing people in from areas of the world we don’t know where they come from. We don’t know where their documents are. They say they don’t have documents. They have no papers. No nothing. We let them in. How stupid can we be?
So this is called "The Snake" and I think it’s pretty good. All right? Are you ready for this? A couple of you have heard it but some of you haven’t.


"On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. ‘Oh well,’ she cried, ‘I’ll take you in, and I’ll take care of you.’ ‘Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,’ cried the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived. ‘Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,’ sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. ‘You’re so beautiful,’ she cried. ‘But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, heaven’s sake you might have died.’ Now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. ‘Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,’ sighed the very, very healthy snake. ‘I saved you,’ cried the woman, ‘And you bit me. Heaven’s why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.’ ‘Oh shut up, silly woman,’ said the reptile with a grin. ‘You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.’"
Right?
That’s what’s happening to our country, folks. That’s what’s happening to our country and we can’t let it happen. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. And if we’re not, we’re not going to have a country.
And we need borders and we’re going to have borders.
And we need great trade deals and we’re going to make great trade deals.
And we can’t let Mexico and I have great respect for Mexico and I respect their leaders but we can’t let Mexico and China and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs.
When you look at what’s happening in Wisconsin – and you see it – the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics. I just read – all I did, I stood up and I read statistics. You’re losing jobs...It’s very average. It’s very average.
Our country is less than average. Okay? Our country is doing so badly. And it’s just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough. We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct. We have to do what’s right for our country.
When the great Ford Motor Company – great company – when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we can’t let it happen.
When Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced they’re moving to Mexico.
Pfizer is moving to Ireland.
But let me just tell you. So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts. But more importantly, they’re taken care of.
You know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, "Donald, let me ask you a question. These politicians – are they really that dumb?" I said, "No, they’re not actually that dumb. Some are. But they’re not actually that dumb. They’re all taken care of by the special interests. And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington."
Hey, who is better than me? I mean, take a look at me. I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not what’s right for you but they will do what’s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off.
And a lot of times, I’ll say, "How can a deal be so stupidly made? These people are so stupid." They’re not stupid. They’re doing it for themselves. They’re doing it because they want campaign contributions. They’re doing it because they want money put in their PACs. They are totally controlled by the money. Believe me. They are totally controlled by the money, and that’s not good for our country. Okay? That’s not good because terrible things are happening and we’re getting weaker and weaker.
Hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out.


You look at the jobs we have. Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it’s all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States. And it’s a disaster what’s going on in our country. We’re not going to have jobs left.
And they do it with manipulation of currency. And they do it with guile. They do it with so many different elements that our people don’t even know what’s happening.
Our politicians in most cases don’t even know what’s happening. And when they do know what’s happening and they let it happen, it’s even worse.
So I’m not taking money from anybody. I’m self-funding my campaign.
And we’re going to get it. We’re going to get it.
Now, I look at this U.S. manufacturing – I mean, just look at this. Look at these charts. I mean, you can see them...This is where we’re going.
You know that’s not good. Right? This is where we’re going.
There was one that I just saw. Just got this. It’s like incredible.
Look at this. This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000. Look at that chart. Another couple of years, there won’t be any jobs.
And the jobs we have now are bad jobs. These are bad jobs. These aren’t good jobs. And everybody admits that. Even the other side says, "We agree. They’re bad jobs."
And the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment – it’s a fictitious number. When you stop looking for a job, you’re considered statistically employed.
It was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy.
The economy is not good. The economy is bad.
We’re sitting on a bubble. The banks have money. They give it to you for nothing if you’re rich. If you’re not rich, that’s when you need the money, they don’t loan it to you. So the people can’t do jobs.
Probably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can’t get the banks to give you money. The banks are controlled by the regulators. They system that this country is run under is out of control.
And we’re going to change it. We’re going to bring back the jobs. We’re going to bring back our companies.
And you know I’ve had such a response. And the reason I’ve had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today.
I’m in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads. "We’re going to bring back jobs" – he’s using my same language.
Here’s the problem. They don’t know where to begin. They don’t know where to begin.
And if they did, Lyin’ Ted, lyin’, he comes up. Did you ever see a guy like this? Just look what he did with Ben Carson.
Ben Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin’ Ted, remember in Iowa, he said "Ben has left the race. He’s left the race." This was on election day. It’s not like two days before or the day after. "During the election, he left the race." Okay? And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz. It’s pure deception. It’s lying.
And then there were many other things. And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, "You’re a liar." And I said, "You know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it." So we now call him Lyin’ Ted – Lyin’. It’s crazy. It’s crazy.
I mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible. And you know, I’ve met a lot tougher people but I’ve never met any human that lied as much as him.
And he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have? I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University. I have all of these people. I have such incredible support.
And the evangelicals – he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don’t like liars and they see he lies so much.
Do you ever see him – he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high. Right? Held high and then he starts to lie.
Boy, he is bad.
So anyways, I don’t think that you’re going to fall for that. I really don’t think that anybody is going to fall – he doesn’t talk. He debates...I said, "Ted, take it easy. Just talk. Talk. Talk."
But we’re doing really well. The whole thing is just working out. And I loved being here. You know, I’ve been here for a long time. I’ve been here for a long time. I’m going here – we’re going to stay tomorrow. We’re going to have some, I think I’m doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning. I’m doing some shows tomorrow. We’re going to do some shows and we’re going to be around and we’re going to make sure – we want to bring this home.
If we can – you know, we have a movement going on, folks. And it’s a movement of intelligence, actually. It’s a movement of common sense. That’s all it is.
We’re not going to let Carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to Mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country. It’s not going to happen anymore.


And I’m a free trader. And they say, "He’s not a – " Remember Jeb Bush? "He is not a conservative." I said, "What?" I am a conservative. But you know what? I believe in free trade.
But when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade.
If you don’t have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they’re controlled by the establishment. I mean, look at the establishment.
This guy in his whole life didn’t know what the word establishment meant. Now you have all these people going because they said, "Oh man, Trump is terrible. He doesn’t want any of our money."
I had one friend that came into my office – I don’t think I’ve ever said this before. He came into my office. He wanted to give me millions of dollars. I said, "I can’t take your money. I don’t want your money. I’m self-funding." He said, "No, no, no, you’ve got to be kidding." He didn’t even know. He thought I was kidding. He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me. I said no, no, I don’t want. Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn’t want his money and he’s leaving. And I said, "By the way, what are you going to do now?" He said, "I’m going to give it to another candidate." And I said, "Why?"
They’re gamblers. They have to do it. It’s like almost a disease. They have to do it. It’s the craziest thing.
He loves me. He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million. Right? I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money.
And my whole life, you know, I’ve said this before, my whole life as a business person is this. Right? It’s okay. Nothing wrong with it. I take. I keep taking. I take and take.
But now I’m going to take for the United States. We’re going to take. We’re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We’re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We can’t be. We can’t be.
And with NATO when they don’t pay, you know, I said – I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO.
Now, you know, I’ve been a businessman. World class. I filed my business papers. They were phenomenal. Everybody says great, great, great. I built a great company. Very little debt. Tremendous cash flow. Some of the greatest assets in the world.
And I tell you that only for one reason – that’s the thinking we need in Washington. We need some of that thinking.
And Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television. He said, "Let me just ask you about NATO." Now, I haven’t been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and I’m like a smart person like many of the people in this room. Hopefully all of the people in this room.
But he asked me about NATO. I said, "It’s obsolete." This was my first thing.
And you know what? I’m the first one.
Guys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, "I don’t believe it. What he just said, I never thought of it." They study it because they’re so into it that they don’t realize because it was really put there.
You had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say that’s a balance. So we’ll leave it.
But it doesn’t really cover terrorism like it’s supposed to. Doesn’t have the right countries. I mean, many of the countries and there aren’t – that you associate with terrorism.
And so I said number one, it’s obsolete.
I said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people?
And the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes – headlines the next day – "Trump doesn’t want NATO, wants to disband NATO". And that’s not what I said.
I said, you’ve got to pay your bills. And you know what? If you can’t pay your bills, honestly, there should be – they’ve got to go because we can’t do it. You know, this isn’t 68 years ago. This isn’t when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things.
But it is interesting. Some of the smartest people have said "What Trump said is genius. It’s obsolete. And you know what? It’s true." There’s a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride. We can’t have the free rides any more, folks.
...Thank you. Well, we need somebody with that...And it’s America first, folks. It’s America first.
So then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem. North Korea is a problem. A problem that could be solved easily by China but they don’t want to solve it because they want to tweak us. They’re building in the South China Seas a massive military fort. You know what’s going on. They shouldn’t be doing that.
And they’re taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money. How about this? We owe China $1.7 trillion.
Now, they take our money. They take our jobs...I’m not angry at China. I’m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen.
I’m not angry with China. If you can get away with it, you do it.
But they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money. They take everything.
We owe them $1.7 trillion. That’s sort of like a magic act. Doesn’t it? Amazing.
Japan, they send cars by the millions. They come off those boats. Los Angeles – I was there at the docks. I looked at the biggest boats you’ve ever seen. Biggest, greatest ships you’ve ever seen. The cars are pouring off the ships. We owe them $1.5 trillion.


It’s like, well, how does this all happen? Okay? How does it happen?
Here’s the story, folks.
We’re going to change our thinking. We’re going to be the smart people again. We’re going to be so smart. We’re going to be so sharp.
So a lot of people don’t know we protect Japan. Do you know that? Does anybody know? You might know...We protect Japan. We protect Germany. We protect South Korea.
When you want a television set, who do you get it from? South Korea. Samsung. LG. You get it from South Korea.
So we protect all and big ships they make. These are monster, monster economies. We protect them.
They don’t pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply.
And you know what? We get that because we have people that don’t know what they’re doing in Washington for many years. I mean, I’m not even blaming it – Obama’s the worst. He’s the worst. The worst.
I mean, when he just realizes, I mean he just realized that the Iran deal is a bad deal. It just took him – realize – I said, "Oh, why didn’t you listen to me two years ago?" Just two years ago if he would have listened – can you imagine? Did you ever see a deal take so long?
By the way, usually when a deal takes that long, it’s bad automatically. I can usually tell you that.
But anyway, so we protect Japan. So it comes out...I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and I’m talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea. We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, "We love protecting you." We don’t want them to arm necessarily. But you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this?
So we have to see them and we have to say, "You’ve got to help us out."
You know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we’re sitting on one of the worst bubbles you’ll ever see. Okay? Believe me. We’ve got to straighten it out.
We’ve got to straighten out our trade deals. We’ve got to straighten out our military deals. We’re taking care of all these countries.
So we go to Japan. And here’s what the...I was telling the people and they said "Wow, that sounds good." We’ve got to take – you’ve got to take care of us.
Now, they’ll probably say initially "No". And then we leave and then they’re going to say, "Yes."
But if they don’t say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk. You have to be...
The problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur. Call him amateur night. He refused to walk. They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran. They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made. They were saying "This deal is unbelievable." They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country. They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great. And they were dancing. Remember? Burning the flag dancing?
When they start dancing about a deal that I’m making, when they start burning the American flag, I’m out of there. Bye bye. Good luck.
And he just kept going back.
And I kept waiting. I wanted to call him. I wanted to call him. I wanted to say, "Walk." Because every single thing – he’d say, "We would like to get this." "No!" "Oh, okay. You’ve got it. We would like to get that." "No!"
You know, the Persians are great negotiators. It’s an unbelievable deal.
But just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that he’s very unhappy.
I mean, think of it. Think of it. $150 billion. It’s the worst deal. We didn’t get our prisoners back. We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating. Increase the sanctions. Don’t sit at the table. Say "You give our prisoners back or we’re not starting." You leave. They’ll say "No". You leave. And what happens? You double up the sanctions. Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, "You’ve got your prisoners." That could have been years ago. Right?
So we have people that don’t know what they’re doing.
Here’s the story. You need Trump. You do. You need Trump. You bet...You do. I mean, you’ve got to have Trump.
I mean, it’s sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people.
I see these ads and they’re mostly wrong. A little bit sometimes are right but they’re all negative. You know. And I’m looking, I’m watching this on television – ad after ad.
In Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide...Does anybody read? Does anybody watch television? You know, it’s not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million – a record number in Florida.
They spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide – listen to this one – 55,000 negative ads on me. Most of them was made up.
I’ll give you one good example.
We have the Club for Growth, which is forget them. These are among the dumbest people that you’ll ever meet.
They come to my office. They want me to give them $1 million.
A friend asked me, "Please see them." I said, "Who are they?" "They’re Club for Growth." Whatever that means.
So they come to my office. They asked me for $1 million. I say, "No, thank you." And that’s it.




Then they write me a letter, which I posted, asking me for $1 million. I said very nicely – I’m not a bad person – I said nicely "No, thank you." I mean, you can be rich but you don’t have to be stupid. Okay? Why am I going to give them $1 million?
So, what happens is all of a sudden I see their name all over the place – "Club for Growth" and they talk about, you know, different things – ridiculous things. I mean, they’re the worst ads.
And by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, "If Cruz and Kasich got together and you added the delegates" – and they showed the delegates. Right? And you add them up – and I’m over here with a lot. And they said – and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and it’s much lower than mine.
They’re a fraud. And what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago. And we tweeted about it. And everybody’s talking about it. And I see it last night again.
They’re crooked. So here’s what they do. It’s like a form of extortion, I guess. Right? When you think of it. They come to your office. They ask for $1 million. You don’t give them $1 million. They go out. They do negative ads.
These are the people – you know, if these people about Trump – they call it like "No Trump". What do they call that thing? They call it "Never Trump". Oh, you need Trump so badly though.
I was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him. They would have had great budgets. They would have had everything they wanted.
But with him...I always say, "Obama is the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen." You look at the – no, except with the Republicans. He gets everything he wants.
I mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted – fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn’t be here. He got everything he wanted.
So he is the worst negotiator worldwide.
We have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. Right? We get Bergdahl, a traitor. No, no, think of it. This is a negotiation. We get Bergdahl. And they get – what do they get? Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which we’re not closing down by the way. Okay? We’re going to run it.
So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six – probably six – people were killed going out to try and get him back. He left. He’s a traitor.
So we get Bergdahl, and that’s what we get. And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us. Okay?
We’ve got to stop it. We’ve got to stop it.
So with Japan, I said they got to – maybe we’ve got to walk. And the next day the headlines – "Trump doesn’t want to defend Japan", "Trump wants Japan to get their nukes".
Okay, here’s the story, folks. You have Japan. Japan is very concerned with North Korea.
You know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money. They probably will. But if they don’t, it’s not so bad if they are at heads. Maybe we’re not supposed to get into that fight. That’s a bad fight. Maybe we’re not supposed to. Okay? Okay?
Same thing with South Korea. I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over. We do all sorts of exercise. What are we get out of this? We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.
So, we have to be taken care of.
Now, I’m talking as a person financially. Okay? I’m also talking militarily. But I’m talking financially.
We don’t have a country that can do this anymore.
Saudi Arabia, until the oil went down and now they’re still making a fortune. But Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We protect Saudi Arabia. If we weren’t there, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be there. If Saudi Arabia didn’t have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as Saudi Arabia. Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back.
And by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq. Everyone says, "Oh, Trump is going to be very tough." I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning.
And I’m going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before. But you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Nobody’s going to tell us what to do though. We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted.
But if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense. We’d be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster. You see the great migration. It’s a catastrophe.
You see what’s going on in Germany. It’s a total mess. What she has done.


Can you imagine? She was Person of the Year.
I was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine. She beat me out and she destroyed Germany. Can you believe this?
That’s not good. I wonder if Time Magazine had that one to do over again what they’d say. I think we’ll be in much better shape. Well, they’ve treated me nice. I’ve been on the cover a lot.
And the reason we’re on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen.
So here’s the story. Here’s the story.
You know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, "What you’ve done is incredible." I said, "No, no, I have to win." He said, "No, no, it makes no difference. If you win, if you lose, it doesn’t matter. What you’ve done is down in the history books. You will be cover for all time. It’s incredible." I said, "No, sir. No, sir. I have to win. Because if I don’t win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time."
So here’s the story. Here’s the story. We’re going to take care of our Second Amendment. It’s being chipped and chipped.
We’re going to get rid of Common Core. We’re going to bring education back locally.
We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total catastrophe. You’re going to have great health insurance.
We’re going to save your Social Security. We’re going to save your Medicare. We are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again. We’re going to bring back our jobs. We’re not going to let our jobs go. And we’re going to be able to afford – you’ve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell. It’s not going to happen. Okay? Remember that. It’s not going to happen.
We’re going to start winning again, folks. We don’t win anymore. We don’t win anymore. We don’t win with our military. We can’t beat ISIS. We’re going to win. We’re going to knock the hell out of ISIS.
We don’t win with our vets. Our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Our vets are being treated so unfairly. They’re our great people.
And other people – you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, "You know, Mr. Trump, we follow closely what’s going on. You’re the only person that ever mentions the vets." Right?
And Hillary Clinton recently said about the vets that they’re being taken care of just fine. They’re not being take care of fine. They’re not being taken care of. She said they’re being taken care of just fine.
I know the vets. Nobody’s spent more time with the vets that are running. And we’re going to take care of our vets. Okay?
We are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals.
I have the greatest people in the world for dealing.
We use political hacks that don’t know what they’re doing. They’re dealing against the smartest people in China, the smartest people in Japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and we’re not using them anymore.
We’re using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they’re endorsing me, and I know the best ones from the not so great ones. And we’re going to have great, great trade deals.


We’re going to have a strong border. We’re going to have a real border. We’re going to have a wall. Mexico is paying for it. We’re going to have a wall.
And we’re going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country. Because if you look at what’s going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, it’s – the drugs are pouring like water. They’re pouring across.
You know when I won – New Hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory I had. And I won New Hampshire, and I wasn’t expected to win it; Jeb was expected to win it. And I won it in landslide.
And I’d go around and I’d see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, "Mr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin." I said, "Heroin?" It doesn’t make sense. You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes. I said, "Heroin?" It just doesn’t work. It’s incongruous. Right? It doesn’t work. But it was heroin. And I said, "If I get in, we’re going to stop that problem." Then I said, "Where does it come from?" They said, "It comes from the southern border. They come right in."
Now, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem. They have a tremendous problem. But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem. We’re going to stop it cold, folks. We’re going to stop it cold.
And the bottom line is this. Look, we have a big, big day. And you’re going to look back on this evening and you’re going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country. We love the country.
...I love you too. Thank you.
Really do. I love the people. I love the people.
You know, they say Donald Trump – my base is so strong. They say, "Donald Trump can do almost anything." In fact, one person today said "Anything".
And they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room I’ve ever been. It was very clean, and I only want clean. I don’t care about the room. I want clean.
But they were sitting there and they said to a woman – a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there. And they said, "What would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?" She said, "Don’t play that game. There’s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him." And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set.
I wanted to – I wish I could find out who she is. But we have so many people like that. We’re all like that. I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because we’re tired of stupidity. We’re tired of seeing what’s happening to our great country.
So, here’s the deal. You’re going to go home and you’re going to remember this.
But much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you. You’re going to be so proud of your country. You’re going to go out and vote. You’re going to be so proud of your president. But forget that. You’re going to be so proud of this country again.
And you’re going to remember the evening because we’re going to start winning again. We’re going to win on trade. We’re going to win with our military. We’re going to knock out the ISIS.
We’re going to win. We are going to win with the military. We’re going to knock out ISIS. We’re going to knock them out.
We’re going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly. It’s not going to happen anymore.
We’re going to win at the border. We’re going to win with education.
We’re going to win with our Second Amendment. So many people talk to me about the Second Amendment.
We’re going to win at every single element of what we’re doing. And every single thing we’re going to win, win, win.
And you’re going to say, "That was the single greatest vote that I have ever cast", and you’re going to look back and you’re going to be proud of yourselves and you’re going to be proud of your country again.
So thank you very much everybody. This is a great, great honor. Thank you!
Get out and vote! I love you all! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you!


Thank you. I feel so badly. Outside we have 5,000 people and they can’t get in. I feel badly. I want to apologize. We have speakers outside. But I want to apologize. Who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in.
...It’s an honor to be here. It’s an honor to be with you. And very important. You know, we’re doing really well and millions of votes ahead of Cruz. Millions.
You know, I get a kick. I call him Lyin’ Ted. Lyin’ Ted Cruz. He stands up – and I win as you know, you’ve seen it. I have been winning all of the evangelical vote. But he stands up Bible high, puts it down and then he lies. You know, it’s amazing to watch it.
But he said, "Yeah, I’m the only one who can beat Donald Trump. I’ve done it time after time."
And I said, "Wait a minute. I’ve won like most of the states."
I think he had like 5 or 6 and I had 20 or 22. Right?
And I said I can’t believe it. And I have millions of votes more.
He says, "I’m the only one that can out-vote him." And I’m saying but I have like millions of votes more.
I’ll tell you something so important. There is something happening. It’s like a movement. It’s incredible. It’s a movement. And we’re part of the movement.
Not me. I’m a messenger to be honest. I’m a messenger.
And this is something that’s so special and so amazing and it’s on the cover of time magazine. It’s on the cover of every newspaper. It’s something that has maybe never happened and they’re saying it’s phenomenon.
Sometimes they say I’m a phenomenon. I’m not. The message is what we want.
We want jobs. We want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals.
And you know, Wisconsin. I wrote down some notes...and it’s like devastating.
So [Scott] Walker came out today. I wrote down notes about Wisconsin.
Look, he certainly can’t endorse me after what I did to him in the race. Right?
But look at this. By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit. That’s terrible.
By the way, these are out of books. Like this isn’t Trump. This is out of books.
Total state debt is $45 billion. Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that’s wrong but again these are – $45 billion. Very high. One of the higher ones.
20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000. So your population is higher.
Now, I wouldn’t have done this but he endorsed Cruz. What am I going to do? Am I going to say he’s doing a great job? He’s not doing a great job.
You know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley. I love Harleys. Right? But the motorcycle guys like Trump. They really like Trump.
And he doesn’t look like a motorcycle guy to me. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
Unemployment rate – well, they say – that can’t be possible. Unemployment – they have down 20%. That can’t be possible. What? Is it 20%? Effective or regular? Effective unemployment rate 20%. Hey, this is out of the big book.
800,000 food stamp recipients.
Middle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs. These are the stats. Right? You know about this, right?
It goes on and on.
Wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA.
Now, just so you understand, Kasich is running also. We forget about him. He voted for NAFTA.
Both of them want TPP. TPP – Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both of them want Trans-Pacific. That will make NAFTA look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.
...


...But the motorcycle guys love Trump.
I love the disabled veterans and the veterans. We’re going to take care of our veterans. You know that, right? We’re going to take care of our veterans.
What is it about Trump that they like?
I’m serious. We went to Hilton Head. We went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there. Beautiful bikes. Lots of Harleys, right? Lots of Harleys. Made in America. But beautiful, beautiful bikes...
I don’t know what it is but they like me. I feel good with them. I feel safe. I got out took a picture. Secret Service went crazy.
I said, "These are great people. Don’t worry about it."
But listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it.
...We’re going to keep you free. I’m going to keep you free.
Because we’re getting rid of ISIS.
We’re going to have good borders. We’re going to have borders again. We’re going to have borders again.
So here we have something that’s pretty interesting – I love you too.
You lost 70,000 jobs to China. 70,000 jobs.
100,000 illegal immigrants living in Wisconsin. Taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars.
Look, I don’t know. I don’t know.
So what happened with Walker and I just will finish off with this – he’s a nice man. He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did – you know, I’ve been a politician for about eight months, right? I never thought I’d be a politician. The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician.
But I built a great company. I filed papers. The company is incredible. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world.
And I say that not in a bragging way. I say that because that’s the kind of thinking we need, folks.
We can’t have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam. We can’t have it. We can’t have it. And they are ripping us like they’ve never ripped anybody before.
We’ve rebuilt China. I mean, we’re rebuilding Mexico.
You look the other day you saw Carrier moving down. Carrier Air Conditioning. I buy those air conditioners – a lot of them. I’m not buying any more of them. But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico. Ford moving to Mexico.
Nabsico – home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we don’t eat anymore. Right? We don’t eat it. We don’t eat it. Number one, it’s a good – it’s called an enforced diet.
But you know what? Look, we’re losing our jobs. Look at your jobs.
When I see that statistic, I mean you’re losing your jobs.
When I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, "You know, I’m going to be nice to him. He’s a nice guy." The guy came up to my office. He handed me a plaque because I supported him. What do I know? I supported him. I gave $50,000 or $100,000. That’s a lot of money for a guy you’ve never met before. Right? That’s pretty good.
But I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting.
You know, to a certain extent, I’d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess.
But he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque. Beautiful picture of something. I haven’t – I never really got to read it to be honest. And I put it aside. That was it...
Because if we win Wisconsin, it’s going to be like over, pretty much over. Because we’re going to do great.
...Emerson poll came out. I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good.
I watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center. I watched New Yorkers dying.
Believe me, New Yorkers are good. New Yorkers are very good. But Cruz said they’re no good.
So anyways, so I think we’re going to do great in New York.
We’re going to do great in New Jersey. Chris Christie endorsed me. We’ll do great in New Jersey. Good guy.
Ben Carson endorsed me. Sarah Palin endorsed me. Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff Joe.
And you know, with the evangelicals, I’ve had so many ministers. I’ve had so many pastors endorse me. And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me. It was incredible and we’ve done so well with the evangelicals. I mean, Christians, evangelicals, we’ve done so well.
In fact, in South Carolina, when we went to South Carolina, that was going to be Cruz’s territory. He was going take it, except we won it in a landslide.


You know that. You saw it. He was there. This guy follows me around, I’ll tell you.
But you were there. Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide. And then I started speaking. I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly.
And we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals. I’ve won just about I think almost every place I’ve won with evangelicals.
And it’s been an amazing time.
So now I’m here to talk to the people of Wisconsin. I have friends in Wisconsin. I’ve been here before. It’s an incredible place but it’s a place that has problems.
But you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn’t have a problem.
I remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him. I said, "How can I hit him? I’m not going to hit him. I’m not going to hit him."
And I was so nice. I hit Jeb instead, right? Right?
And I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand.
And I hit a lot of people and they all went down.
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive? You know.
But it’s not with the mouth. It’s really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain. Remember the brain.
I have a lot of friends. They’re good with the mouth but they’re not good with the brain. It all doesn’t work. Okay?
You know, we had an interesting thing today. A poll came out – a nationwide poll. A great poll. It was Trump 48%. It was an NBC poll. Trump 48%. Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something. And Kasich was way down.
So what happened is they showed the poll. It was an NBC poll. They call it an NBC monkey poll. And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe. Morning Joe held it up and he said, "Wow, those are great numbers."
48% is pretty good. You have three people. You know. I don’t get enough credit for that.
I’ve been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and I’ve had like seven people. How do you get 45% when you have seven people? Nobody says that. They say, "He hasn’t cracked 50%." How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running?
So I’m at 48%. Poll was good – way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide. And they showed Hillary Clinton – hers is very close.
She’s got a little problem. Could happen. Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you. She should have. Her bigger problem should be with emails. We’ll find out how honest our country is, right?
But she’s got a sort of close race. And they put her poll up and it was put up there. You know, big letters.
And then they said, "And Donald Trump is winning." That was it. They didn’t put numbers up. They didn’t say I’m doing great. In fact, they said, "Donald Trump is winning," and they put some – a little slightly negative statistic in – it was like wait a minute. They put her numbers up and they didn’t put my numbers up.
Folks, it’s so unfair. The press is so dishonest. It’s unbelievable. That was Chuck Todd. That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show.
They put Hillary’s numbers. And I’m winning by a lot and they said, "Donald Trump is winning. You know, let’s go to a new subject, okay?"
Now, I guarantee you one thing. If I was losing or doing poorly, it’ll still be up. It’ll be up all morning because they don’t like what’s happening. I’m self-funding my campaign. I’m putting up my own money. They don’t like it.
Ted Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries. They’re getting money from the pharmaceutical companies. They’re getting money from everybody.
Folks, you can’t straighten out this mess – we’re in a mess – if you can’t do what you have to do.
When millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, you’re not going to be able to say, "Well, we’re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what’s right for the people" if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars. Now, that’s true with Hillary also. Now, she’s gotten millions of dollars.
But I’m the only one self-funding my campaign. I’m in for a lot of money. I in a lot of money.
What is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire. I was in for like $2 million. Jeb was in for like $48 million. I was in first and he was close to last.
I said, "Who do you want as your president?"
By the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet? Because I haven’t heard. Because I think Jeb probably endorsed – huh? Did he endorse? It just shows you how important it is. Nobody even knows. I don’t even know.
He’ll probably – he’ll endorse – just so you know. Look, when you’re in war, you’ve got to fight and you fight hard.
When I fight, I win. You’re going to win. You know that. You’re going to win.


But you know, you do pretty serious damage, right? Because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don’t love you after you finish.
But I just love you. I don’t care about that.
In fact, they’re asking Cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said I won every single debate. Now I heard the other night, "I want to debate Trump". I’ve debated him 11 or 12 times. Every single online poll has me winning the debates. He’s an okay debater but he’s a bad talker. You know, everything’s so dramatic.
And he waits. Phony. And he waits. You know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds. And then he goes again. It looks like we’re in the theater. We’re not in the theater. We’re in the real world.
So what happens – thank you.
...By the way, the Sheriff is here and he’s a great guy and his people are fantastic. Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you.
I mean, the only thing I feel so guilty about all the people outside. Feel so guilty. We’re going to come back. We’re going to come back, come back to this area. You guys cannot come. Okay? All of the ladies can come but the guys can’t.
But all of the people outside, we’re going to take a bigger place because I feel slightly guilty.
But look, we have a very serious mess on our hands. We have a very serious situation.
We have a country that’s not protected.
We have a country that’s sitting on a big fat bubble that’s going to explode. In a certain way, I’d say let it do now, don’t do it after I get in. Three days it’ll explode and they’ll say it’s Trump’s fault. Okay?
Ayeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble. We have interest rates that are so low that if you’re rich like me I can borrow money for any amount. If you’re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you’re a hardworking developer or businessman you can’t borrow money.
You can only borrow money really cheaply – think of how bad it is – you can borrow money for nothing practically if you’re rich. But if you’re rich, you don’t need the money so you don’t have to borrow it.
But if you’re a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can’t get it.
The regulators are running the banks. Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster.
But the biggest disasters are regulations. Our rules and regulations are horrible. We’re going to get rid of probably 85% of them. There are some we live with. But we’ve got to go back.
So many people in this area have told me regulations – regulatory climate – is the worst they’ve ever seen.
I have a friend, who’s a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental. It’s like a puddle and they’d consider it a lake.
So we don’t know what we’re doing. So here’s what’s happening. We’re going to make our country so great again. We’re going to make our country so strong again.
Our military is going to be so amazing. We’re never going to have to use it.
Don’t forget, I didn’t want to go into Iraq. All these guys think that I’m a tough guy so I’m going to be so quick with the trigger. I’m not going to be quick.
I was the slowest with the trigger. I didn’t want the trigger.
Now, when Obama left though, he shouldn’t have left the way he did. He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, "It can’t be possible. Nobody would be that stupid. Nobody."
So I actually don’t think it’d hurt that much because I don’t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date – "We’re leaving on this date." And then he left. They said, "He was serious!" They pulled back. They pulled back. Then you see what happened. They pulled back then they went in with fury.
But how about the 50 soldiers. He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them. What does he do? He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that "We are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria" and these soldiers have a big target on their backs.
Why can’t we just keep our mouths shut? Why can’t we be unpredictable? Unpredictable? Right? Why can’t we be unpredictable?
Why does he have to tell – first of all, it doesn’t even sound good when you say "50 soldiers" because it sounds like so small. People would say, "Is that good or bad?" I mean, that sounds small.
But then when you think about it, why do we have to say that?
These are extraordinary people. These are our finest. And they’re, you know, very dangerous missions. Why would you tell people that we’re sending them in? You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something.


They are right now – who knows what’s happened to them? But right now, they have a big target on their back.
People that we’ve let go of at Gitmo have now killed Americans. You’ve seen that. You saw that yesterday. That came out yesterday. We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans. Okay. Is anybody surprised at that though? Would anybody be surprised?
And we’re keeping it open. Now they’re spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it. I guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper. You’d have a lot of money left over.
So we’re going to get efficiency in government. But we’re going to end Obamacare. We’re going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive.
We’re going to get rid of Common Core. We’re going to bring our education local.
We are going to preserve our Second Amendment. It’s under siege. It’s totally under siege.
And Christianity is under siege. I’ll tell you, Christianity is under siege.
You take a look. I’m with the – I’ll tell you what. I’ve been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example – was telling me that – first of all, he told me something that "You remind me so much of my father." I thought his father was a great guy. What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University. And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place.
But when Jerry was so strong and so great.
But I was talking to – I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they’re really under tremendous pressure because they don’t want to have their tax exempt status taken away. This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
And I said, "Why is it that you folks are pushed around so much?" Christianity. These are the pastors. These are strong people. These are really strong people. "Why do you allow that? Why aren’t you more forceful?"
And finally, somebody said, "Well, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status."
I said when did that happen exactly? It was during the Johnson.
Well, we’re going to try to get rid of that. Okay? Because that’s really terrible.
We’re going to try getting rid of – and I’ve said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians. We’re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody that’s an evangelical.
You take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless.
They’ve actually taken their right of free speech away.
So I said we’re going to try to get rid of that and I think we’ll be very, very successful.
You know, it’s interesting. I said how many Christians are there? Because you know, we’ve got men, we’ve got women. You cut it in half, we’ve actually have a few more women. But we are far more Christians than we have men or women. So in a way, it’s the most powerful lobbyist – the biggest group of people.
But they’re not allowed to talk because they’re petrified.
You saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups.
So we are going to try and usually when I say try that means I’m going to get it done. That means I’m going to get it done.
But we are going to try very hard. We are going to get that brought back and I think it’s going to be very hard to counter it.
Because if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat –
You know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat.
Now people are saying, "You know, Trump is sort of right about that." Now they’re all going, "Wow" because they see what’s happening.
And I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition. That’s what’s happened in this country. That’s what’s happened in our country.
And we can’t let it happen. We’re going to turn this country around and we’re going to be the smart people. We’re not going to be the dummies anymore.
We’re not going to be where China made last year trade deficits $505 billion. Japan over $100 billion. Mexico $58 billion.
We’re going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Okay?
...Recently, I was in Florida and Marco, who’s a nice guy actually. You notice how nice they are after you’ve defeated them?
I like everybody I defeat.
But when I ran against Marco, it was supposed to be...well, he started it. Right? Just like Cruz started the last deal. He started it.
But Marco came after me very viciously. You know he wanted to be Don Rickles, right? And it didn’t work.
But what happened is I won by 20 points – almost 20 points – and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues. And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier. I wanted to stay in Florida campaign. I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio. I would have won in Ohio but I didn’t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that.


So if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same.
But I’m not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin. We have to win.
If we – look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks. It’s time.
And believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend he’s an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor.
So believe me, believe me, they’re all establishment.
And frankly in a way it’s worse because Cruz is establishment and yet he’s got no relationship with the establishment.
He goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators – look, I know. They’re tough cookies. I have the best – I have one of the great people – Sen. Jeff Sessions, who’s great.
Nobody better than Jeff.
And you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech – "Sen. Jeff Sessions" – and then he comes out and he endorses me.
But when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter – Lee – who’s his friend. I mean, he’s his friend. And by the way took him plenty time to do it.
But you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished.
Cruz has not accomplished one thing.
So he’s an insider but it’s almost like the man on the street because he can’t get anything done.
He dislikes people. He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell.
I mean, he said some terrible things about – how do you get things done when you’re calling Mitch McConnell bad names. Okay? Let’s just say bad names.
So he’s sort of got the worst of all elements. He’s an insider totally but he can get nothing done. Okay? He can get nothing done.
Your new Speaker – how do you like Paul Ryan? How do you like him?
Wow. I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because – really?
Well, he’s the Speaker. He’s a nice guy. He called me the other day. He was very nice.
But I’m very surprised at this statement. Wow. Are you all Republicans? Are you mostly conservatives?
...I always say I’m just a common sense conservative. And so, so important – common sense.
And somebody told me today that somebody else – I think, Walker – used my term.
You know, Walker used – I said, "Make America great again." I said, "Make America great again", and I copyrighted the term.
And then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying "Make America great again" because he saw the response that I got. The difference is he didn’t get any response. So then no.
But we told him he can’t do that. That was the first real problem I had with him...
Now, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he’s a common sense conservative.
Well, I coined the phrase a few months ago. That’s what I am. I am a conservative.
I’m very, very conservative on the military. I’m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things.
But – and I’m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say "He’s not that conservative on trade because he doesn’t believe in free trade." Well, actually I do believe in free trade. But it’s got to be good trade for us, right? It’s got to be smart trade.
It can’t be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can’t get into China but China comes in here like it’s Swiss cheese. That’s what happens.
You know, China does not obey the rules.
Now, I get along great with China. I made a fortune dealing with China. I have two buildings because of China. Big ones in New York and one in San Francisco – Bank of America – that I have in partnership with a great company. And it’s because of China. I sell – I have one of the big leases with one of their big banks – with the biggest bank in the world actually from China.
I sell millions of millions of condos to people from China. I like China.
I’m not angry China. I like them. I think their leaders are doing a great job for them.
But our leaders are doing a bad job for us.
Same with Mexico. I get along great. The Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. But their leaders are killing us on the border and they’re killing us on trade.
And I’m not angry at them. I’m angry at our country and our leadership because it’s grossly incompetent and we’re going to change it around and we’re going to get the best and we’re going to get the finest.


...So whatever you can do to spread the world, I’ll be around. I’m going to Green Bay. I love their team, by the way. You talk about a great franchise. No, I love it.
And you have a truly great quarterback. I don’t know. He’s probably endorsing somebody else but I don’t care. He’s still a great quarterback.
Tom Brady’s a friend of mine. He said you have a great quarterback. That’s all right with me. When Tom says he’s a great quarterback that’s pretty good.
But you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, we’re going to put all of this stupidity away.
We’re going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and I’m talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal. How bad is that I mean, just as a deal...
But many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they’ll say, "How can our politicians be so stupid?" They’re not stupid. They’re being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune. Okay? They get tremendous campaign contributions. They’re not stupid. They’re doing it for themselves.
So again, I’m not doing that. I’m doing for you. I’m working for you.
But just remember, they’re not so stupid like you think.
But when you look at the people funding Cruz’s campaign and Kasich’s campaign, and you look – don’t forget – Cruz said, "Oh the banks, the banks." You know, he’s going to be Robin Hood. He’s going to be this great guy.
And then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks – Citibank and Goldman Sachs. He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have – a very low interest rate. Almost no interest. He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form. He just forgot. He said, "Oh, I forgot. I forgot."
Okay? So then he hits the banks. He’s controlled by these people, folks. Okay? I mean, what he did was absolutely wrong. But they’re controlled by these people.
I’m controlled by you. I’m going to do the right thing for you. Okay? So remember that.
...
Q&A






22 veterans a day commit suicide. That’s correct.






We’re going to take care of our veterans so much. Look, let me tell you, they – many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor. They can’t even get to see the doctor. You know that. They end up killing themselves before they see the doctor.
22 a day and a lot of people don’t even believe that number. They think it’s almost like an impossible number – how can it be so bad? – and it actually could be even worse than that.
We are going to take care of them. From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more – six, seven, eight days.
And sometimes they’ll see the doctor and the doctor says, "I can’t see you now. I’m going on vacation."
You see the corruptness.
I just left Phoenix – 21,000 people. Sheriff Joe was there. The job he did was incredible. Incredible.
You know they had a little protest. Right? That protest ended so quickly. He arrested three people; everyone else scattered.
You know, and you have that kind of a Sheriff here. You have a tough cookie here. I can tell you. I just met him and I can tell you.
But you know I have a great policy plan and I’ve gotten a lot of credit for it and it’s on DonaldJTrump.com. And with the veterans when they’re waiting for exorbitant time – even for a little time – they’re going to go to the doctor. They’re going to go to local doctors or local hospitals.
Many of the hospitals are dying for business. You know that they’re dying. Some of these hospitals are dying. They’re going to get immediate treatment, immediate service, we’re going to pay the bills, and we’re going to save a fortune, and they’re going to get great service.
And everybody is in love with it. Everybody loves it. And that’s what’s going to happen. So we’re going to take care of our veterans.
If we can’t take care of our veterans, we can’t take care of anyone. So we’re going to take care of our vets.






Boy, do you look good though. You look good and tough. I wouldn’t want to fight you.
Do you think I can take you in a fight? I don’t think so.
How about we do it right now? That would be great for television...
Go ahead.






...Let me tell you this. Our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our country...You don’t even have to write it down. We’re going to do things about it.
You know what you’re saying? I’ve heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else. We are going to take care of our vets.






By the ways, speaking of increase, Cruz and Kasich want to destroy your Social Security, folks, okay?
I want to bring money back into this country. I want to bring jobs into this country. I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country. I want to take our wealth back from China, from Mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth. They’ve taken them like we’re a bunch of babies.
And we’re going to save your Social Security and we’re going to save your Medicare. They want to get rid of it. Okay? Remember that.
...
I want to use not too many executive orders folks. You know, because executive orders came about more recently. Nobody ever heard of an executive order.
Then all of a sudden Obama, because he couldn’t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they’re butter.
So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.
But look, just do me a favor. Stick with me. You’re going to be okay. All right?
...I know, what you’ve said I’ve heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem. Huge problem. And your wife not working? Huge problem – she can’t. So anyway, I bet you have a great wife. Good wife? Better believe it.






...We’re ending Common Core. You’re not going to be educated – your kids in Wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in Washington, D.C. by bureaucrats – many of whom – I can’t say all – but many of whom don’t care for your kids. They couldn’t care less. They get big, fat salaries. Your kids are going to be educated locally.
We’re terminating Common Core, and you will see something that’s magic. And I’ve seen it where parents and all of these people – the uncles, the aunts – they’re all on the school boards. They get professionals. They have great principals.
You can’t see what’s going on from Washington, D.C. Many of the people never even come here. They sit behind their desk in Washington. They draw big salaries. And they’re telling you how to educate their kids. Not going to happen that way.
And I’ve even seen it where they keep graduates – the child graduates and those parents stay on. They love it because their child went through the system. They love it and they become so good at it. That’s what’s going to happen.
We’re one of the worst in the world in education. We’re going to be one of the better ones. Not necessarily – you know, I don’t know that we’re going to beat Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and China. But we’re going to come very close.






Discipline in schools. I don’t think that Wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline. You have a big problem with discipline?
...Well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school. We have to get discipline –
I mean, I have a case. I have a wonderful guy – campaign manager. You talk about discipline. And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager. He’s a good guy. Corey [Lewandowski].
And by the way, the easiest thing – "Corey, you’re fired." I can’t do that. Can’t do it.
So fortunately, I have a taping system. You know, very – I’m rich so I have tapes all over.
So this young woman who complained, was all – she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this. I said, "Oh, that’s horrible." And then we saw the tapes.
Did anybody see the tape? What did you think? Right? Nothing.
Women – what did you think? [Audience response inaudible]...
I mean, she wasn’t like – her face stayed the same.
If somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad – don’t forget – initially she said thrown to the floor. But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn’t you start screaming or something?
Did you see any change in her face? [Audience response inaudible]
...It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Honestly, it’s horrible.
And the best thing I could do is say – but I can’t destroy a man. I’d destroy him. Got a beautiful wife and children and I’m not going to destroy a man for that.
And you know what? When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, "Oh, this is terrible." Then I saw the tape. It’s my tape. I’m the one that had the tape. It’s on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and we’re all leaving and we have a press conference. Right?
And the press conference lasted a long time. It was like 45 minutes. So that was enough.
I’m leaving with a whole big gang of people. People pushing left and right, left and right.
And all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture. She grabs me or hits me on the arm. In fact, I’m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit. But I didn’t – it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me. Right?
[Audience response inaudible]
Like he was helping her. And did you see her fall to the ground?
[Audience response inaudible]
Okay, because she talked about falling to – now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground. You know, all this. I could read it to you. Does anybody want to hear it?
I mean, I want to be accurate because I’d like the press to treat me.
So before she knew she was on tape, she said "I was jolted backwards."
Was she jolted backwards? I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same. I mean.
"I was jolted backwards. Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down. Campaign managers aren’t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground. She never even came – flinched.
She didn’t – you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you’re "Whoa!" Right? I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman. Look at her face. It’s zero.
They’re going to destroy a man’s life?
And then I have Cruz saying, "Oh, that was a terrible thing. That was a terrible thing."
Let me tell you something, folks. If I win, if I lose, I didn’t need to do this. I’m doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka. Ivanka and Jared – beautiful, beautiful grandchild. It’s my eighth. I’m doing this all for them.
I didn’t need to do this. This is not so easy. And I had no idea. You know, maybe none of us did. You know, I had no idea the message was going to get across. It’s a message of competence. It really is. It’s a message of common sense and it’s a message of competence.
And I had no idea that we’d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney – a total stiff – who by the way he’s a dope. He’s not a smart person. I’ll tell you right now.
Let me tell you about Mitt Romney. That was an election he should have won and he lost. And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what? That’s an election that should have been won.
And I’ll tell you what. I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing. But he lost.
And I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost. And I said, "This time, we’re going to do it ourselves. We’re going to win. We’re going to win." So just remember that.
We’re going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope...








Right! She’s so smart. I don’t want them to know. I don’t want to tell Putin what I’m thinking. She’s so smart.
What you just said...what about Ukraine? Don’t worry about Ukraine. Ukraine is going to be fine. Just don’t ask me why.
You know, this world of politics – "Mr. Trump, you said -" don’t forget I’m the one that said take the oil. I was right. They didn’t take the oil. You know who has the oil right now? ISIS has the oil.
You know, that Libya – ISIS has all that oil from Gaddafi, all of that big oil from Gaddafi. He took it. We’re like a bunch of dummies.
Why aren’t we embargoing? Why aren’t we creating a nice big circle so they can’t get the oil out? Why aren’t we taking that oil back?
Look, look, look, I’m the one that says though I don’t want to say everything.
If I win, I have a good chance of winning. I’m the frontrunner by a lot. I want to go in there. I want to knock the hell out of ISIS. I don’t want to tell all. I really mean this.
I don’t want to tell everybody in this room – and look at all the cameras that are going now – I don’t want to tell the world what I’m going to do because they’re watching.
Just let me do it folks. I will do it. You would be so happy. You don’t have to know the details. Okay? Let me do it.
You know, I used the word before. We have to be a little bit unpredictable. We can’t say, "Well, we’re going and attack on March 14th and then we’re going to hit them from the front and then we’re going to hit them from the back."
You know, Obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities. He said, "We’re going in next week."
Look, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust – there has to be some trust. Right? Do you trust?
We’ve got to stop the stupid. That’s why I really think your question is so great – "I don’t want to hear how you’re going to do it, Mr. Trump. Just do it." I’ll do it. Okay?
I love that. That woman! That woman! Thank you, honey. Thank you.


Okay. I can see why.
Woman:
Thank you. You have been – I just want to say thank you. You saved me in so many ways.
In recent years, I’ve been struggling with an incurable illness and I’m on home care now. It’s caused by a doctor’s medical negligence.
And in those dark days fighting – right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son – in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, "To the bravest woman I know."


I remember that. I remember that. Such a wonderful, beautiful woman. I mean, just an amazing woman.
And are you coming along okay?
Woman:
No, sir. But that’s okay because I’m here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream.
And I wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son who’s Mexican-American, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college.


That’s great. And you know what we’ll do? We’re going to watch him. You’re going to watch him. We’re going to be watching your boy. Okay? But you’re going to be hopefully around. You’re not going to have to have anybody watching. You’re going to hopefully be around. Those doctors are going to be so wrong. But we’ll be helping you.
Woman:
So we thank you. God bless you. And just, you know, he’s a Mexican-American, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college. And I have been writing letters to him for when I’m in heaven to tell him that what you’ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us.


That’s so nice. Thank you.
I have to go down and say hello. Is that okay?


...Very sad but I think it’s going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that. You watch.
But it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, "Oh, it will cost a lot." Forgetting about the campaign. That’s peanuts by comparison. You know, I’ve spent tens of millions of dollars.
But the big thing – I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant. I bought it very inexpensively many years ago – 15 years ago – and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television.
Now, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful – I was very happy with that. But I didn’t want to sell it. But I sold it and I built it to really a great company. We did a great job with that company – Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.
But other businesses – I sort of – like the shirts and the ties with Macy’s. Macy’s was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties. Who care? I mean, that’s not a big deal.
But I’m doing something – nobody is giving up what I’m giving.
I mean, when Cruz runs, he runs. If he wins, great. If he loses, great. You know, it’s him. He’s a politician. They just – they run, they win, they lose, who knows?
But these guys run for office. That’s all they do.
I’ve always heard that if you’re a very successful person, you can’t run for office, especially for president. You just can’t run for president, and I can see it. I have so much false press about me. Things that are so false.
You know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me. 56,000.
In fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks. Adam Scott – the great Adam Scott – the great golfer. He was winning. And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump. Negative, horrible, negative commercials. Mostly false. Mostly. Not all false. But mostly false, I have to be honest.
But it came out the other day, I think it said "$68 million, 55,000 negative ads." Negative ads.
And when I was running in Florida, I said "How is it possible to win?" I mean, with all of this because I knew it. You couldn’t turn on in Florida where I was you couldn’t turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials. Sometimes four or five in a row. And they were horrendous. Done by very, very bad people. Very bad, evil people.
And I said, "How it is possible to win?"
And God helped me. Honestly. Because I won in a landslide. I won by almost 20%.
And now they’re doing it here. Club for Growth. It’s a crooked outfit.
Look, Club for Growth – you ever hear this? Club for Growth – a friend of mine, he’s a conservative guy. He goes would you do me a favor? See Club for Growth. I said, "What’s Club for Growth?" He said, "They want to talk to you." I said, "All right. Send them up." He’s a friend. He’s a good guy. And now I’m in politics so I have to see people I wouldn’t normally...
So Club for Growth, they come up to my office. This guy was I think a former Congressman. And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and I’m falling asleep. And then he goes, "$1 million." And I said, "$1 million for what? I don’t even know you. I’ve never met you." I said, "Do me a favor." I’m trying to be nice and I said, "Go back and write me a little note if you can." And he was stupid enough to write me a note.
He writes me a letter asking for $1 million. I let him know that I’m not interested. You could be rich. I’d rather take a million and throw it all over this room. I’d rather give it to you, to your boy.
...They write me a letter. It’s like extortion. They asked me for a $1 million. I said no nicely. And then they’re doing ads all over Wisconsin. Club for Growth. They did it all over Florida. Club for Growth. About eminent domain.
By the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn’t have highways, you wouldn’t have hospitals, you wouldn’t have bridges. You need eminent domain. If something’s in your way and you’re building a highway, if you’re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone’s property, every once in a while.
You know, it’s funny. These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline. Right? Everyone. Conservatives. Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline. I like the Keystone Pipeline too. But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn’t go 15 feet. They wouldn’t be able to build it.
So, they don’t want eminent domain. They do commercials about eminent domain. They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because you’ve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where he’s representing. Think of it.
This guy – and don’t forget that. Remember what I said. I’m going to win. Just remember what I said. I’m going to win. And I thank you...
I’m going to win. But remember this. If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing – remember, I’m a good prognosticator, I’m a good predictor – the first thing that’s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, he’s wrong. And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that.
Remember this. If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn’t get – because it’s all establishment. You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, I’m not the establishment. I don’t take their money. I don’t hire their people. I don’t do any of that stuff. Okay? So you have a disadvantage.
But if Cruz wins, remember what I said. Just remember. Again, he’s not going to win. But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesn’t have the right to be president. And I think they’re right because he wasn’t born on our soil. He wasn’t born. He’s not a natural born citizen. He’s not a natural born citizen.
I don’t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody. He is not a natural born citizen. So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe you’re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you’re going to have somebody that’s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit.
Again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago. Did anyone know that? So he was a senator from Texas, only because of the great Sarah Palin by the way, without Sarah Palin, he could have never won that election. It was a fluke. But he was a Senator from Texas. He lived – he was a joint citizen. Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago. He said, "Oh, I didn’t know I was a citizen of Canada also." Just like he didn’t know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money. I mean, this guy is – you just have to study him, folks.
Look, again, I’m doing this. We’re going to win. We’re going to turn this country around. We’re going to make America great again. We’re going to win a lot. But you have to know the facts.
I love you all. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Get out there and vote! Thank you!




Thank you. Thank you! Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening. This was a great evening.
They just announced North Carolina.
I don’t know if they’ve even announced Illinois yet but we’re leading by a lot so I think they’re going to announce it.
Florida was so amazing.
And I want to thank our friends. Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning. I heard very early in the morning – nine delegates. That’s a lot.
And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day. That I can tell you.
Many things have been happening over the last short period of time.
CNN was very nice. They came up with a poll. The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%.
We just had one from the Economist just came out – 53%.
And it was sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who I’m not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said "But Donald Trump doesn’t get over 50%" because I’m at 43%, 45%.
Actually now according to the Economist, I’m at 53%.
And I have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I don’t get over 50%, we have four people. Right? We have four people. Do you understand that?
So when I get 53% – and this one is an example, I had 53% and that’s with four people. That’s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%.
So someday, someday they’re going to understand, someday when we take it all, they’ll understand. But it is really ridiculous.
I want to thank my family. My boy, Eric and Don. They’ve been working so hard.
Ivanka and Jared have been amazing. Ivanka’s home right now. In about two minutes, I’ll call her. She’s about to have a baby so I don’t know. We’ve been thinking about that now for a little while but Ivanka has been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and it’s been just great.
I want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore. And I want to thank Barron. I never see my Barron and it’s his birthday on Sunday so we’re very happy about that.
So it’s a little tough. You know, we’re going away and he goes, "When are you going to be come home, daddy? When are you coming home?" I said, "Well, in about two and a half weeks." It’s been pretty tough.


You’re traveling all over the place. It’s really amazing. Yesterday I went up to Ohio. I went up to Youngstown.
We had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country. We have so, so many great people.
We will someday in the not so distant future if I win – otherwise it’s not going to happen I have to be honest with you. But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of –
And we’re not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it’s Carrier air conditioning, whether it’s Ford, whether it’s Eaton.
I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they’re leaving and so many companies are leaving. And frankly, I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it. It’s just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they’re going to Ireland.
And there’s so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people who can’t get their money back into the country because the politicians can’t get along. They can’t make a deal.
Everybody agrees – Democrat and Republican – everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven’t been able to make a deal.
And we could make a deal. There’s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you’re doing because everybody wants to do it.
And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we’re going to lower by the way. But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that’s their money because there’s no way of bringing it in.
So, we’ve got a long way to go. But I think at some point it’s going to get done. This has been very exciting, this whole process.
We started, I was one of 17 people – senators, governors. I’ve had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us. Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us. That was so incredible.
And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us. She was great. She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she’s done in Florida is incredible.
You know, so many – we’ve had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day – tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation.
The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together.
We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody’s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they’re talking about it.
Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. I’m looking at the polling booths. I’m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it’s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman – one woman was there for 40 years. She’s been working the polls. And she said, "We’d have two people here. We’d have three people. Now look at the line." And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it’s just a different thing.
We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before. It’s an incredible thing.


I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah’s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He’s tough as nails. He’s going to be fine. But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.
So, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down. Yeah, sit down everybody. Please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago. We give you seats. You don’t have to stand. I’m looking at all these people.
Cory, good job, Cory. Good job. And Hope and our whole squad. Right?
So when this began, Melania and I and I said, "Got to do it." And she was so supportive and she’s been so supportive. It’s been amazing. And we have to do it.
We came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were – we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail.
We went up in June. Most people said I’ll never run. He’s just going to have fun. He’s having a good time. This isn’t necessarily – I mean, I’m having a good time. You know, I’m having a very nice time. But you know what? I’m working very hard and there is great anger. Believe me. There is great anger.
One of the broadcasters was saying, "Is there anger?" And I said...I was supposed to say, "No, there’s not. We love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. It’s wonderful. You give them $150 billion. We get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful. You lose $500 billion a year with China. We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance. It’s a total imbalance."
We don’t make good deals anymore. We don’t win anymore. As a country, we don’t win anymore.
And they asked, "Is there anger from your people?" ...They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders. They want to see good health care. They want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt. Our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt. Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that’s going to happen.
And you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly.


So, we started and something happened called Paris. Paris happened and Paris was a disaster. That was – there have been many disasters. But it was Paris.
And then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on.
And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals. We’re going to make the best trade deals you’ve ever seen.
We’ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they’re the best in the world. We have the best business people in the world. We’re going to have such great deals. We’re going to do so good with trade. We’re going to do so good on the border.
But it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country and that’s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up. And I’m just very proud to be a part of this.
I think we’re going to go. We’re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think we’re going to have a great victory.
And I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again. We don’t win anymore.
We don’t win with our military. We can’t beat ISIS. We’re going to knock the hell out of them.
We don’t win at trade – China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country. Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us. We don’t win at trade. We’re going to win at trade. We’re going to make our country rich again. We’re going to make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, I’m sorry to tell you.
So, I’m going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could have happened. I guess we’re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also.
But to win the states that we’ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is incredible. It’s record-setting.


And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. He’s tough. He’s smart. And he’s got a great future. He’s got a great future.
But I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. By the way, mostly false. I wouldn’t say 100% but about 90%. Mostly false, vicious, horrible.
They said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million.
And you explain it to me because I can’t – my numbers went up. I don’t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up.
I mean, it’s been an interesting experience. Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral. Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, who’s a great guy – I guess a lot of you folks saw that – but I’m watching...we have television screens all over. We’re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on. The worst commercial and I’m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I’m saying, "Look over there! Look! Don’t watch it. Don’t. You don’t want to watch it." I’m saying, "Isn’t the grass beautiful? Look! Look! Don’t watch."
And they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal.
And then Adam comes in. He’s this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament. He’s a great champion. And we’re giving the award.
And just before we break for a commercial, "We’ll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott" and here’s the commercial and I said, "No!" And it was two of them – two of them. Oh, what a day that was. What a disaster. What a disaster. Unbelievable.
So again, I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It’s an amazing process. It’s very tough. But it is – by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there’s nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people. It’s true. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some really disgusting people back there.
And I just want to say we’re going to go forward and we’re going to win. But more importantly, we’re going to win for the country. We’re going to win, win, win, and we’re not stopping. We’re going to have great victories for our country.
Thank you very much everybody! Thank you!


...So it’s so important. You getting out to vote. It’s just so important because our country has been taken away from us. It’s going so fast.
And you know, you’re talking about Second Amendment because I was asking with Randy and a lot of people, I was talking to some of the people before, "What would you like me to focus on?" and they said, "Just Second Amendment. Second Amendment."
Now, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too...The Second Amendment in under siege. You know that. You know that very well.
We lost a great Supreme Court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation. And all of a sudden if somebody gets in that’s the wrong person, they’ll take away that Second Amendment so fast your head will spin.
You see Bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the Second Amendment. Hillary is a disaster on the Second Amendment. No, they want to take it away.
So, it’s just not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.
...But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person.
I just heard coming up, you know, the Senators. We’ve been very disappointed. I’m a Republican. Many of you are Republicans. But we’re not being protected whether it’s a budget. You saw the budget that was approved a month ago. It was approved by the Republicans. They gave it away. They gave Obama everything.
So Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge. He said he wants – he’s going to be a very negative person to guns because that’s the way it is, okay? Believe me, that will be the way it is. And basically they don’t have the right to do that.
But I keep saying, "Well, are the Republicans going to fail or are they going to crack? What’s going to happen?" And coming up today, I hear, "Well, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through." Here we go, right? Here we go.
Same thing you heard with Obamacare. It’s going to be defeated. It’s going to be repealed. We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Believe me.
But – I mean, look what’s going on with your premiums. 35%, 45%, 55% up. Your deductible is so high. I mean, you’ve got to see that truck right there? You’ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it.
So, I come up and I’m hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, "Donald Trump will not be the president. He will not be." No, it’s a compliment. Look, he’s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States. So it’s a compliment.
But he was all over the place yesterday. Said, "Donald Trump will not be – " I think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in South Carolina.


You know, New Hampshire was so amazing. We had a big, big victory in New Hampshire. Amazing people.
And then we come down here and I said, "You know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here."
And the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak. Even this. I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he’s a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people. You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I won’t forget it. Believe me, I’m not going to forget it. I’m not going to forget it.
So I hear that they’re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that – and this is one of many. This is one of many but a judge that doesn’t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn’t know how important it is.
We’re just not going to let it happen. Okay? It’s not going happen. And if we elected, we know that. But we have 9 months, 10 months to go. We have to have the Republicans hold fast because I’m just hearing these little cracks, saying "Well, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe." It’s not the way it’s supposed to be.
Now, it’s possible that they’ll have their wish because if they win, they’re going to be having their choice. But if they don’t win, we’re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges. This was not supposed to be one in question. This was a very sad circumstance that happened with – I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance. But now we’re going to see what happens.
I will only tell you this. We are doing well. We have a really good chance to win. If we can win in South Carolina, we’re going to go – I mean, we could very well run the table.
I don’t know if you saw – I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada. It’s going to be phenomenal. The relationship there to the people...Bush is 1% in Nevada. This guy – why doesn’t he just give up, just go home? Go home. Go home to mom. Got to go home to mommy. You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada. A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%. I’m at like 40% something – 48%. So I think we’re going to do well.
Then I think we have the SEC. We’re going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing.
But really now we’re starting. New Hampshire could not have been better. They gave us a tremendous send-off. They really started us on our way.
And we did well in Iowa. I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace. What Cruz – what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace. What he did was – he stole. It’s theft. And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as I’m concerned. And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace. So we’re not going to let that stuff happen anymore. I mean, we’re not going to let it. We will not let it happen. We’re all watching. You’re all watching. Keep your eyes wide open.
These politicians – here’s a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things. Very bad.
So politicians are bad people. Boy, they are bad. Would you believe it?
So we’re not going to let it happen and we’re going to get in there...So Saturday. Go out and vote. This is going to be the place that’s really going to make it.
And honestly, I’ve been watching all the pundits. Now, the bad news is they’re always wrong. They all said I’m not running and I ran. Well, how is he going to do? He’s just doing this for fun. I’m not doing this for fun. Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else. Okay? I could be someplace else right now. I could be very happy.
But I’m doing it because you know the expression and I see all the hats in the audience – Make America great again. We are going to make America so ... ...
We are going to win again. You know, we don’t win very much. You’re very smart, tough people. You like to win. Right? This guy over here. You like to win. And we don’t win anymore. We used to win. We don’t win anymore. Well, we’re going to start winning again. We’re going to start winning again.
So, Second Amendment protected. Common Core. We’re going to end Common Core. We’re bringing your education locally. It’s going to be fabulous. I don’t know if you know or if you’ve heard me say we have the absolute worst – we spend number one in the world on education. Right? Number one per pupil in the world. There is no second place because we’re so high, so much – you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden. You have these countries are the best in terms of education and they’re on the list the best. And the 30th in the top 30 – we’re number 30th. Okay? We’re number one in costs.


That’s a little bit like what I’m doing. I’m the least spent money. You know, I’m funding my own campaign. Right? So, I don’t have a lot of the people coming to me. You know, the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the United States, a lot of it isn’t really waste, fraud, and corruption. It’s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they’re special interests and they do what those people want. And that’s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack. The military orders equipment they don’t even want and the stuff they do want they don’t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it’s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don’t want. It’s going to all change because I’m not getting any money from all of these people. I don’t give a damn. I mean, we’re going to do the right thing. We’re going to absolutely do the right thing.
I’ll tell you a little story. So the drug companies. We are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the United States...which makes a lot of sense I guess. But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we’re going to end. Okay? We’re going to build a wall. Yup. Folks, by the way, we’re going to build a wall and who’s going to pay for the wall?
[Audience: "Mexico"]
You better believe it. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. And these characters come up, these politicians that I’m running against, "You don’t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?" I said, "Absolutely, 100%." They said, "How are you going to get Mexico to pay?" And I don’t want to get into it because they won’t understand it. I mean, they have no concept of business. They have no – you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept.
We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Okay? The wall is going to cost $12 billion. Maybe less. If I build it, it’ll be taller, better, and less. Okay?
So you think of this. So you think of this. So they said, "How are you going to possibly do it?"
They make so much money. Plus we give them subsidy. They make so much money from the United States it’s going to be one of the easiest things.
And I don’t know if you’ve heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of Mexico held a news conference. He said, "We will never ever, ever pay for the wall." And the press called me. They said, "They said they will never pay for the wall." I said, "Who was it?" Calderon. He’s very nice, good guy. I said, "Tell him the following. The wall just got 10 feet higher." I mean it. It got 10 feet higher. Yeah, they’re going to pay for it.
And I get along great with Mexico. The problem is – I mean, they buy apartments. I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who I’m doing great with. We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and they’re great people.
The problem is the leaders of Mexico are too smart for our leaders. They’re too smart. They’re too cunning.
You look at what’s going on. It’s unbelievable. The border is a disaster. It’s a sieve. People flow over. It’s not going to happen anymore, folks. People can come into our country but they’re going to come in legally. They’re going to come in through a process. They’re going to come in, they’re going to come in legally.
So with trade, we’re going to solve the trade problem. I don’t know if you saw Carrier air conditioner announced two days ago they’re moving to Mexico. Nabisco. They’re moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico. Ford, they’re moving this massive complex – they’re building a $2.5 billion plant and now they’ve just announced they’re building it bigger.
I’ve been talking about this for two years. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced they’re building it bigger. In another words, they’re doubling down. You know why? Nobody does anything about it. I’m going to do something about it.
So I watched – somebody asked, "What would you do about Carrier?" Because that was a sad case. Somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, "You’re out of work. You’re out of job. Forget it. It’s over. We’re moving to Mexico." Are crying. Grown men that have been there for a long time. Really incredible people. And they’re crying and they’re devastated and they lost their job and they’ve never had another job and now this plant – this whole thing is moving to Mexico.


And they said, "What would you do?" I said I’ll tell you what I’m going to do because you know they talk about free trade. I’m a free trader. But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters – these idiots. I mean, they’re like stupid. They say "Donald Trump is not a true conservative because he taxes." It’s got to be fair stuff, folks. It’s got to be fair. I’m a conservative person.
Hey, I’m the most conservative on the border. I’m the most conservative with the military. Nobody’s tougher than me. I’m the most conservative. We are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobody’s ever going to mess with us, folks. We won’t have to use it.
I’m the most conservative on taking care of the vets. Our vets are treated horribly. We’re going to take care of our – I’m the most conservative on Common Core. We’re ending Common Core – I told you that – and we’re moving it locally. And nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the Second Amendment. So all of these things.
But with Carrier...they’re coming across and they’re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from Mexico – probably – we’ve probably given them subsidies. They probably have the United States giving subsidies to move out of the country. That’s how stupid it is and that’s how stupid we’re running...They said, "What would you do?" I say it’s very easy. We call them. We say let’s have a meeting. Here’s the story folks. You’re moving to Mexico. Congratulations. But if you don’t stay in the United States you’re going to have a problem. But here’s what you do it. You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, it’s going to be wonderful. Hire your people they’re not from the United States. All those people are now looking for jobs. Those are good jobs. You know we’re hiring a lot of part-timers now...The numbers are totally phony. The 5% – totally phony numbers. So I say here’s what we’re going to do. Very simple. You build your plant in Mexico. Enjoy yourselves. And you’re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States? No, you’re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner. It’s true. It’s the only thing you can do.
And you know what? It’s the only thing you can do. There’s nothing else. Because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop?
And then you have the devaluation with China. The all-time. They’re like grand chess masters or grand – I mean these people are the greatest – the greatest in history. They’re grandmasters of that – devaluation. They devalue their currency.
Japan is doing very well too. They’re killing Caterpillar. You know, they’re ordering Komatsu tractors now because they’ve devalued – look, you take a look at what’s happened to the Yen and it’s very hard. A friend a mine. He’s a big excavator. You all know excavators. I love excavators. This guy’s a very big one. He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators. He just put in a big order for Komatsu. Not that he wanted to. He said, "Donald, they made it impossible for me not to buy. They’ve devalued the yen to such an extent – Japan – that it made it, I mean, I owe it to my family, to my company, to myself. I have no choice." And he was like depressed. He wanted to buy Caterpillar...
Well China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they’re doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete. We can’t allow that stuff to happen.
Look, when we send stuff over to China, it doesn’t get in. If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax. You know, it’s not supposed to be that way. You know, it’s supposed to be free trade. It’s supposed to be they come we go, back and forth. They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible.
I have a friend who’s a great manufacturer. He said it’s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do. He can’t get his goods into China. When he does get them in, there’s a tax to pay.
I have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he can’t get it into China because the tax is so massive. He’s going to sell it now at a big loss. Okay?


And think about Boeing. Okay? Think about Boeing. Boeing is building a plant over here. Boeing just had a big order from China. But China is making them build a massive airline facility. Right? Massive. Like bigger than anything you’ve seen.
Okay, you feel good about Boeing right now. Tell me in five years. Unless I’m president. You’ll be fine. Don’t worry about it. But tell me in five years you’re going to feel good about Boeing because I’ll tell you what’s happening. They are going to build that plant – they’re building it, it’s going to be finished soon – they’re going to build that plant, they’re going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you’ll be reading a big front page story all over the place that Boeing is going to leave, right, South Carolina, they’re going to make all their planes in China. Because this is what they do. That’s what they do. And our leaders aren’t smart enough to stop it, okay?
I have Carl Icahn endorse me. Great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful. If I told Carl, Carl, watch over China trade, we’re going to be in great shape.
We have right now people that have no concept of what they’re doing. They have no concept of what they’re doing. They’re political hacks. That’s what they are. They’re political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people China. And again, China likewise, I get along great with China. Largest bank in the world my tenant. They buy condos for tens of millions of dollars. I have the Bank of America building in California. I own a big chunk of that. I got that through China through a very complex set of transactions but through China.
I mean, I think China is terrific. I’m not angry at China. I’m angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China. I’m not angry.
So we’re going to get things changed around. We’re going to use our best people. We’re going to be so smart, and we’re going to start winning again. We’re going to have strong borders. We’re going to have strong military. We’re going to take care of our vets. We’re going to have such great trade deals. We’re going to win again. We’re going to win again. We’re going to win so much.
And you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of ISIS and we’re going to get rid of them fast.
I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning. I was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn’t have done it. We did it. Then Obama got out the wrong way. We shouldn’t have done Iraq. We did it. It destabilized the Middle East. Exactly. If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily. They’d fight, fight, fight. Boom. Then they’d rest. Then they’d fight, fight, fight for years and years and years. We decapitated Iraq and now Iran is taking over. Not only do they get the $150 billion. Maybe the worst transaction I’ve ever seen negotiated. No, no, don’t buy the famous Obama administration.
The worst, one of the dumbest deals I’ve ever seen. I mean, we get nothing. We get nothing.
We should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating. Not now. We should have gotten them years ago.
But if you look at what’s going on and now on top of that we gave them Iraq because Iran is now taking over Iraq. It’s just taking them over.


So here’s what we did. We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place. They’re the best people. Most incredible. They’re tougher than all of us these people. I mean, what they’ve gone through. So the wounded warriors all over the place. You know what we have? We have nothing. We have nothing. We have absolutely nothing. So here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to change things around. We’re going to be smart. And we have – we’ll do what we have to do in terms of ISIS and all. But we have to start rebuilding our country.
We have $4 trillion in the various places. $4 trillion. Not going to happen anymore.
We’re going to have a strong military. But we’re going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals.
I mean, our country is like a third world country. You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East. You go to China. You see the airports. You see the bridges. They have bridges that are so incredible you’ve never seen anything like it. They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago.
We’ve become like a third world nation because we’re fighting everybody else’s battles. And remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we don’t get paid anything. We protect Germany. We protect Japan. Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they don’t have to do anything. If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them. Okay? I mean, who makes these deals?
We protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them. Right? But we protect South Korea. So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune. We protect South Korea. Let me tell you something. Why aren’t they paying? They pay peanuts for what we do.
Every time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready. We have 28,000 soldiers at the border.
So we take care of the world. We don’t get it.
Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. And we rent space there so we can help them. We rent military bases. We pay rent. And yet without us they wouldn’t last for two weeks. They’d be gone.
So we’re going to change all that stuff folks. I mean, I want to be good. We want to be fair. We want to have heart. And we’re not going to let these Syrian folks in that we don’t know who they are. We don’t know where they come from. They’re not coming into this country. They’re not coming in.
I mean, there are a lot of them. I don’t know if you know it. You have a lot of them moving into South Carolina. I don’t know. Have you heard this? And you ought to tell your governor don’t let them move to South Carolina. You don’t want them in South Carolina.
And I know they’ll say, "Well, we have nothing to do. We’re state government." Let me tell you something. If a governor from a state didn’t want to have them, I don’t care what it says, you don’t have to have them...
We want to help them with safe zones. We want to get the Gulf States to pay. I don’t want to pay. We owe $19 trillion. We owe enough. We can lead it but let the Gulf States – they have so much money they don’t know what to do with it. Let them build safe zones.
Look at what’s happening in Germany. It’s a mess. Look at Sweden. Look at Brussels. I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible.
So when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat. Right? Then everybody starts to say, "You know, he’s right."
Same thing – on June 16th, I announced we’ve got to stop illegal immigration. The heat I took was unbelievable. Three, four weeks later they’re all saying, you know, Trump is right. Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant. You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed. Incredible guy. Young man. The father’s a friend of mine – a great guy. You had the veteran – 65-year-old woman – a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in Los Angeles by an illegal immigrant. We’ve got to stop it folks. We’ve got to stop it. We’ve got to be smart. We’ve got to be a country again. We’ve got to be a country again.
So I just want to thank – this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community. I just want to say get out and vote. We’re going to do something you’re going to be so happy with. We’re going to win so much and we’re going to make America great again. That’s what we want to do. Make America great again. So Saturday, get out and vote. Thank you! We love you all. Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you very much folks.


I don’t really think – look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally. I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13. I ended up coming in second. Didn’t devote tremendous time to it. Didn’t devote tremendous money to it.
In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I’m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient.
I came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away – I think 2,500 or something – close to 3,000 votes away. There’s a big difference between second and third.
I think we did really well. You know, as far as that’s concerned.
I think the press – some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn’t want to give it credit.
I think we did very well. I didn’t expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I’m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people.
But it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told "Don’t even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don’t waste your – "
...I’m going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place.
So I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.


No, I don’t think I feel any pressure. I mean, we’re going to just do what I have to do. And if it works out, that’s great. And if it doesn’t, that’s okay too because you know I’m here to do one thing – the theme – make America great again. I’m going to do it.
And I think we did very well – I think we did really well in just about everything we’ve done running for office. I think we have a very good result yesterday. It could have been a little bit better. It could have been one notch better.
But it’s interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they’re at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened – what just happened – they’re at 1%, they’re at 2%, they’re 3%. Nobody ever talks about them. And I’m at 24% or 25%, and they say, "Oh, couldn’t you have done better?"
You know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent.






Well, I think I have – I think it fits me better, probably suits me better. I’ve done very well in New Hampshire. I’ve been here a lot more. I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire.
But I’ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.






I really don’t. I really don’t see that happening. I don’t know what’s going to happen. You don’t – nobody does. We’ll see what – you’ll have many, many people that aren’t doing very well. I am doing very well. But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians – they’re governors and they’re senators – but they’re not doing very well. And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday. And mine wasn’t.
...You know, it’s very interesting. If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number – in the history of the primary.






...Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.






No, I mean, I think we’ll get a lot of Sanders’s voters. You know, they’re very much into the trade world and I’m the best on trade. He mentions it but I don’t think he’s going to be capable of doing anything about it.
No, I think we’re going to do really well here. I look forward to it.






We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.






Well, we do. We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where we’re going to have about 10,000 people. But we’re going to be back and forth very quickly. We’re going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.






Well, I just think, you know, I’m just happy with the way we’re doing. You know, we’ve bonded with the people whether it’s there or here. I mean, there’s just a big bonding process going on.
If you look at South Carolina, it’s the same thing. I mean, we’re doing really well there. But we’ve devoted much more time here and South Carolina –






It’s not a question of learning. I mean, I just want to continue to do well...Our theme – the theme is so important. It’s just make America great again. That’s what we’re going to do. That’s what we’re going to do. Not really a question of learning.


Well, if you look at the second place, people didn’t talk about my second place. They didn’t talk about it as positively as they should have. And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me – that’s a lot of votes by the way – they said, "Oh, he’s surging. He’s surging."
So, I don’t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run – Scott was mentioning before – "One of the amazing things about you, you’ve never run for office before. It’s incredible how you did."






My brand’s doing great. Yeah.






No, I think just work. We’re going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches. We’re going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think we’re going to do very well.






Well, we’ll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people. Same venue, same everything. They had 200 people.
So we have – there’s a good bonding going on.






Well, I enjoyed it.






I have unlimited, I have unlimited – you know, it’s funny. When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million. I have unlimited. That’s not the thing.
The only – you know, I’m a businessperson. I want to spend wisely. And I’m probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven’t had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million.
But I’m self-funding. And I must tell you, I don’t know that enough people appreciate it. I’m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not. So I won’t be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera.
But I don’t know – I was talking to Scott about this before – I don’t know it’s really appreciated by the voters. I’m the only one on both sides that’s self funding. I’m putting up my own money. And I don’t know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don’t think they say "I’m going to vote for Trump because he’s self-funding and he’s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera."






I’m going to tell them and I tell them. But sometimes they like it but I don’t think it’s something they vote for, which is a shame because it’s actually a very big thing. You understand that. It’s a very big thing. It’s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions...or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent. That’s a real positive...
I just don’t know whether or not the voters appreciate it.






I’ve learned that they’re great people. I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic...You know, obviously I was second. I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in. And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far – not even close. I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they’ve ever had before. So I just – I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.


Yeah, I look forward to it.






...No, I don’t think so. I have a very good relationship with Marco. I like him... I don’t see that necessarily.






You’re talking about Iowa? Well, that could have been with the debate. I think it could have been the debate. I think some people were disappointed that I didn’t go in the debate.
If I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing. And the reason is – you know why? Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour.
So if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, I’ll do that all day long.






Well, we’re going to be spending money. We’re going to be spending money – we’re going to be spending a lot of money. We’ll be spending money on ads and we’ll be spending money on the ground game.






I can’t help it, honey, whether I’m celebrity. I mean, this is me.






Look, I think most people say I did a great job in Iowa. I came in second. I spent far less than anybody else. And had I known that I was going to be liked as much as I am in Iowa and people did like me – you will understand that – I would have maybe spent a little bit more and I would have been there a little bit more and maybe I would have won it. But, you know, I’m very happy with it. I have 7 delegates right at the top.
You look at other people in all fairness – senators, governors – they’re, you know, they’re way down.
When I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don’t mention that.






But the one thing is you people don’t mention that. You don’t mention all the other names.
Now, you mention the person, Marco, good guy. But he came in third. And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didn’t. But I came in second.
...I started off on 17th. I was 17th. When I first started, I had nothing. And then I inched my way up – went pretty rapidly actually. And now I’m leading everything and I did okay in Iowa. Pretty good in Iowa.


Well, I think we’re going to have great success here. I think it’s a much different kind of a process. This isn’t a caucusing process. This is a much different – this is a normal voting process. The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.






Well, he [referring to Ted Cruz] insulted me. I mean, he started with the insults, as you know. And he insulted Ben Carson by doing what he did to Ben Carson. That was a disgrace. And he insulted the people of Iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobody’s ever seen before which was disgraceful. No, no, he’s a man of insult.






No, I’m going. I have thousands of people going. No, but we don’t have that invite. I like Mike Huckabee but no, I don’t think he’s even going to be there.






I did. I did. No, I like him. Well, he’s left the race so I feel pretty good about that. He’s a good man.






Well, we’re adding some and we’re adding them pretty rapidly.






...People in your world are saying they possibly could. So I don’t really see one or two. I see there could be a number.






I’d love to finish first. You know, again it would still not be horrible because you’re competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives. I have been a politician for 6 months.
No, but I’d love to finish first.






Wouldn’t horrible but you know it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. I could think of worse things. But I’d like to finish first. I think we will finish first. I’d like to finish first.






...Just so you understand. I am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20...






No, no, that’s merchandise sales. That’s a lot of merchandise sales.






It’s a small amount of money compared to what I put in.






It’s very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17.50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back.






I am. And I always make the reference. I always make a reference to that and I do it every time.






Well, he’s [referring to Scott Brown] somebody that I respect, always liked. And he’s very, very respected throughout the country but he’s very respected here. And everybody wanted his endorsement and I’m very honored that he’s giving it to me and he’s going to give it to me on the stage.






That happens with endorsements. No, that happens with endorsement. It’s pretty common with endorsements.






...A poll came out a few days before that said I was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge.
And again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if I did it. So I would have liked that. But the fact is it could have been the debate. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn’t. But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets. And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa. Wouldn’t be worth it.






I think her email situation is very serious. I have a feeling she’s being protected by the Democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that I’ve seen including Gen. Petraeus.
If you watch and study and read about various lawyers – you know, that’s what they do – they really feel she’s in grave danger and what she’s done is against the law not just against rules. It’s against the law. I just don’t know what’s going to happen because I don’t know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.






I never saw a race where they’re flipping coins. I mean, they’re flipping coins. What kind of a race is that? It’s ridiculous. I thought it was terrible. I mean, you call it a tie. But to flip coins, they say "Okay, you’re going to get this district. We’re going to flip a coin."






I don’t know. I can’t tell you yet. I think he’s [referring to Ted Cruz] certainly was dirty what he did to Ben Carson was terrible. He did the voter violation form. I thought that was terrible. Actually, I thought it was terrible. And when they said that Ben Carson was out of the race and come vote for him, I thought that was terrible.
Okay?
Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you.


Wow, what a crowd. Thank you very much everybody. Such an honor. With the snow coming down and it’s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in. But you know, we won’t wait. We’ll go ahead. Right?
We’ll go ahead.
First of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team. You had a – what was that all about? I turned on the game. I said, "Wow, this shouldn’t be that good of a game." And at the end of the game, I said, "Who won?" Yes? That was great and it’s a great achievement.
I also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson. They had a really bad accident. Some of his staffers were hurt really bad. So I just want to pay my respects to Ben. He’s a good guy – a really good guy – and his staffers and hopefully they get better. Say a prayer for them. Okay?
We’ve had an amazing time today. We’ve been all over Iowa and we’re going to be here tomorrow. We’re going to be here so much you’re going to get so sick of me. You’re going to say, "Please, tell him to get out of here. Tell him to leave. Tell him to go."
But we’ve had an incredible time.
And you know it started really – we’ve had really a pretty good week. The debate last week – everybody watched the debate. And who knew about these debates? I didn’t know anything about the debates. And it’s been fun and it’s been interesting. And I’ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators. Not 100%. Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair.
And you know, a lot of the press hasn’t been very fair.
Boy, look at the press back there. They must think there’s a big event going happen today. Wow, that’s a lot of them – it’s like the Academy Awards.
But we’ve had an amazing – it’s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was – I said, "Let’s go" to my wife, who’s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, "Let’s go. We’re going to make America great again. That’s what we’re going to do."
And you know, it’s hard to do this because when you think of it I’ve never done it before. I’ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I’ve never been a politician. I’ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years.
And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I’m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew.
And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I’m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That’s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, "I’m not doing it anymore. I’m sorry." They wanted to do it so badly.
And Steve Burke, who’s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said "Come on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You’re not going to run. Do it. Do it." I said, "Steve, I’m going to run." I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do.
You know, all my life I’ve heard "If you’re a very successful person, you’ll never run for president. You’ll never really run for politics. But you’ll never ever run for president."
And I built a great company and it’s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in.
You know, first thing I did I announced. They said, "Oh, he’s actually going to do it" because most of them said "He’ll never do it."
Then when I signed...that’s when you sign your life away. And I signed that. They said, "Whoa! He signed that. Well, he’ll never file his financials because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks."


And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable – you didn’t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that’s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it’s supposed to be. And it’s great.
And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that – whatever it is. We need a mentality that’s going to – you know, we’re at $19 trillion in debt. It’s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that’s going to lift it.
And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I’ll tell you right now. You know, now that we’re at it. And they came out some brand new ones – some beauties. And one’s coming out – I guess a big one’s coming out. I don’t know exactly what it is but it’s got to be pretty good because I see the response.
I mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building. Somebody said it’s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is.
And we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it’s really special because it’s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it’s very special to me.
But then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second. I wouldn’t even names. Right? I won’t even mention names. I’m going to be non-confrontational today for a change.
21% for the second. 11%. And then they’re all down. Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%. I don’t know.
Jeb – well, you know, Jeb’s got one problem. He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good.
And his second problem is he’s very weak on illegal immigration. Remember, he said they come as an act of love. I said, "What? They come as an act of love?"
So I think those are two very bad points frankly.


...So South Carolina just came out and that’s 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third. Great.
Florida leading by a lot – 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps.
Georgia just came out. I have 33%.
Yeah, don’t forget that’s 33%. Hard to believe. That’s with 14 people, 15 people. I don’t know when they took it but it was recent. 33%.
Connecticut – now, Tom Brady loves me and that’s sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way. 35% to 18% to 9% to 2%. You know, to nothing.
Maryland just came out. Maryland – great place – 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out.
You ever hear of a place called Iowa? Oh, I love this. We’re doing actually great. First of all, I have to tell you. You know, they never report it. Even CNN doesn’t report it. CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll.
The CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. They don’t talk about it. They talk about – CNN is reporting other people’s polls. So, I call up. I say, "Wait a minute. You’re CNN. You spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because I’m winning by a lot." And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls. But we’re doing well. I think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows.
Gravis just came out – 34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz. PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz. In other words, it’s a little close here. Quinnipiac poll – very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz. And then again CNN 33% to 20%.
So we’re – I think we’re doing good. I think we’re actually doing better than the polls.
Now, I could do this. I could say, "Well, I just want to do well in Iowa." I want to win Iowa, folks. Because look, I love the people. The evangelicals have been phenomenal. I’m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide I’m winning with evangelical – I don’t know if you know that – by a lot nationwide.
With Iowa, I’m doing really well with the evangelicals. We’re doing really well with the Tea Party. We’re doing well – I mean, you hear the numbers. I mean, these are the numbers.
But I actually think we’re doing even better than the polls. And you know, there’s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, "Are you going to vote for Trump? He’s got very, very tough immigration policies. He wants to destroy Obamacare and replace it with something a lot better." I’m going to do that. Okay?
But you know, a lot of people, they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say, "Uh, no I’ll vote for – " and then they’d get in the booth and they say, "Trump is my man." There are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better. But we’ll see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out. You’ve got to do it. Otherwise, we’ve all wasted our time.
You know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible. We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing. And the people are standing there. It was so cold. There was one little group of – despite global warming – you know, you hear about "It was so cold." It was windchill below zero. And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in.
And then you hear the announcers. "Well, will they show up to vote?" And I don’t know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in. Why aren’t they going to go and vote? Or in your case caucus? Why aren’t they going to go and vote? It’s sort of an amazing thing. So we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?


Now, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different. It’s a very interesting system. But it is different.
Here’s what I have to say about Iowa. It’s very important.
So you know there’s a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack. Okay? You know that. You’ll still see me but you won’t see other people. Believe me. I’m loyal. To a fault I’m loyal.
But you’re going to see. I give you my word. I win; they’re not touching Iowa. This is an amazing tradition. No, seriously. This is an amazing tradition. They’re not moving Iowa back.
And they’re not moving New Hampshire either because they’re talking about Iowa, New Hampshire. They’re not touching New Hampshire.
So, we’re going to just keep it the way it is. It really is. It’s an amazing. First of all, you’re amazing people. But all over the country it’s a movement all over the country. The people are incredible. They want to make America great again. They’re going to do something that’s special.
And you know we used to talk silent majority? I say it’s the noisy majority because it’s actually a noisy majority. It’s not a silent majority.
But people are fed up.
So I started on June 16th and we did well. Practically from the beginning we went up. And if you remember, we started at nothing. You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run]. Even when they – my wife said, "You know if you run, you’re going to win." I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "People don’t believe you’re going to run." At the polls. I was getting these little polls. I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls.
...Jeb again, right? Boy, he’s taking a lot of abuse. You know? I told him "You know what? You should use the name Bush. What’s wrong? Use the name Bush. I mean, maybe it’s not working but it’s better than Jeb right?" You know, I really do. Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush. It’s your name. Don’t be ashamed of your name.
So anyways, I wish him the best.
But, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%. And each time the pundits – these real geniuses back here – some of them are sitting back here – these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses – take away the glasses. He looks like a dumb guy, I’m telling you.
But each time these geniuses would say, "Well, he’s reached his plateau. He’s plateaued" at 6%, right? Then it goes to 11%. "Well, you know, this is surprising but he’s reached his plateau." And then it goes to 18%. And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%. Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that. And then all of a sudden you didn’t hear so much about the plateau.
I want to plateau at 42%. You know, 42% with like 14 people that’s pretty good.
But they kept saying, "He’s plateaued. That’s all he’ll get. He’s got these followers."
We have the smartest followers there are. Number one, we have the smartest. And the hardest working followers. We have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what’s happened because our country is going to hell.
We can be nice about it. We can say it nice and soft. Our country is going to hell.
When you look at this crazy Iran deal where we’re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don’t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means. That’s not a good sign. But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol. These are bad dudes. They get 14 plus seven so they’re getting 21 people. And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint. Right to do oil. Right to do whatever they want.


But what do they also get out of that deal? First of all, they’re going to get nuclear. They don’t have to develop nuclear missiles. They can buy them. For the kind of money we gave them, they’re going to buy them. Why are they going to develop?
Remember the deal? 24 days. They have 24 days for inspection period. They also have self-inspection. Right? But we paid $150 billion. And I always say, "Wow. What a great – the Persians are great negotiators." I say what a great deal that is.
...Two weeks ago I started. I said, "Wait a minute. That’s not a good deal compared to the other deal." They took over Iraq. We gave them Iraq. We knocked the hell out of Iraq. We decimated their armed forces. And you know, for years, they would fight. For many, many years, for decades they’d fight, fight, fight. Nobody would win. Fight. They’d rest. Then they’d go back to fight.
And now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq. We gave it to them. Now, they’re going into Yemen. And if you look at Yemen, take a look. They’re going to get Syria. They’re going to get Yemen.
Unless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in. But let’s just sort of leave it the way it is.
They get Syria. They get Yemen. Now, they didn’t want Yemen. But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia? They want Saudi Arabia.
So, what are they going to have? They’re going to have Iraq. They’re going to have Iran. They’re going to have Iraq. They’re going to have Yemen. They’re going to have Syria. They’re going to have everything. They’re going to be a monster. We’ve created this. We have stupid leadership. Really stupid leadership.
So when I started, I said we have to do something about it. It’s not something I wanted to do. It’s something we have to do.
Because I’m representing you. I’m not taking any money. I’m not, you know, like some of these guys where they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and they’re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country. They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they’re representing.
And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they’re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors.
Me, I’m going to do the right thing.
And I always tell the story. When Ford moves to Mexico, I’m going to talk them out of it. When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, I’m going to talk them out of it. Believe me. It’s going to be easy. It’s going to be easy.
So, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn’t even be talking about that subject if I didn’t bring it up.
And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed.
And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We’re going to protect the Second Amendment. We’re going to protect the guns. We’re going to protect your guns.
You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we’ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what’s going on.
We have a president who won’t even talk about the term. If you think, he won’t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can’t solve the problem if you don’t talk about it. You have to talk about it.
So, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris – and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can’t have a gun unless you’re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said "Boom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!" Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded.
But if we had a couple of – few of the people that I pointed out – I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It’d be a whole different story.


So very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don’t want to do it for that reason.
But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who’s an incredible woman, and she said, "We’d like to endorse you."
John Wayne was a strong guy. We need strength. We need strength in this country because we’re withering away with political correctness nonsense. Okay? Nonsense.
I mean, if you think of it, you can’t say "Merry Christmas" anymore. We’re going to say "Merry Christmas" again. You go into these department stores. They don’t have any Christmas displays. They don’t have the sign "Merry Christmas". Even people that aren’t Christian are saying "Merry Christmas. We love Christmas. Let us say ‘Merry Christmas’, Happy Holidays." But people like to see it. And stores don’t put it up anymore. We’re withering away. We’re going in the wrong direction.
So I said we’re going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way. I figured I’d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse. You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out. I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally. We’re up by so much. And you know, I want to keep it that way. I want to keep it that way.
When you think – and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest. But one thing – I’ve spent to this point almost nothing and I’m in first place by a lot. I tell this story. I’m not bragging about spending. I’m just saying I’m telling the story. I have spent – they’ll tell you – almost nothing and I’m in first place by some polls have me 21 points. That’s a lot. Okay? You know some people have 2%. I have a lead of 20%. But I’m in first place by a lot.
Jeb has spent now $77 million. Think of it.
And you know the reason I bring him up – I wouldn’t even bring him up – but he spends a fortune on ads against me. You people have all seen it before
I got along with everybody. I contributed to everybody. I was a world class businessman. Now I’m a politician, which I’d hate to tell you. But you go with everybody. You want to love everybody. You want them all to love you unless you’re stupid. But you want everybody to love you.
Everybody knows this story. But so much money has been spent on me. But he spent $79 million. I spend nothing. I’m in first by a lot. He’s down towards the bottom of the pack.
And I said to myself, "It’s amazing. Wouldn’t that be great if this were the country doing this?"
As an example, education. We’re number 28 in the world. We have third world countries that are ahead of us. Education is very important to me.
World, I mean, countries that you wouldn’t believe are ahead of us. You wouldn’t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries. So we’re 28. But we’re number one in spending per pupil by far.
Wouldn’t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education? You know?
So Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best. We’re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil. So we’re going to change that and I told you we’re going to get it localized but we’re going to change that. Watch, you just watch...
I will tell you this: You can’t educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington. And that’s what happens with Common Core.
When the parents take over and I really mean this because I’ve seen it. When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they’re committed to education. You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington.
And not all of them but most of them are just interested in "Where’s my check? How much do I get? Let’s make the process complicated."
And some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage. Okay? So we’re going to bring that back locally and it’s going to be great.
So what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed. And people are now looking. They know I’ll do great with China. I’m going to do great with Japan. I’m going to do great with Mexico, who’s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border.
We will build a wall and you know who’s going to pay for the wall – Mexico. They’re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things.
But now, we’re really focused on security and I’m honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets. We’re going to take care of our vets big league, by the way. Big league. Big league. And we’re going to really take care of our military. It’s going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody’s going to mess with us and it’s the cheapest thing we can do, I’ll tell you that right now.
So it’s been a real focus.
I just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person. This is a person who I’ve known for a long time, who I’ve respected for so long. An incredible husband. An incredible family. And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored. You have no idea how honored.
And I would like to bring up if I might Gov. Sarah Palin. Special, special person. Thank you.


SPEECH 9
 
(AUDIENCE MEMBERS SHOUTING)


 — let me just tell you — let me just tell you a little secret. It’s the cheapest thing we can do. We’re never going to have to use it. I don’t think we’re going to have to use it. Don’t forget they talk about my tone. I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day — Mr. Trump’s tone is not nice. They’re chopping off Christians’ heads in Syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone. I’m supposed to be, oh, isn’t life wonderful, OK?


 Look, we’ve got to be tough, we’ve got to be smart, we’ve got to have heart too. We’ve got to have heart, we’ve got to take care of people. We’ve got to fix our health care program. This Obamacare is a disaster. You people know.






You people know. Obamacare is a total catastrophe. It’s going to be repealed and replaced. It will die in ’17 anyway. I don’t know if you heard what’s happening. But it’s so bad, all the people that they didn’t think were signing up are signing up.


And the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up. And your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent. Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you’re never going to be able to use your deductible. You’re never going to be able to use it. So Obamacare is a disaster. We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.


There are so many great things we can do on health care. So many good things.


SPEECH 10


Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor.
We don’t want that stuff. We don’t want World Trade Centers. We don’t want that ever happen to us again. It’s not going to happen to us again.
So I want to thank everybody for being here. It’s a great honor.
They have thousands of people outside and sometimes they’ll say "Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in?" But we can’t get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We’re together tonight. Thank you.
So we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa – great, great state – and in Iowa, Trump 33%. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%. But it’s Trump at 33%. It just came out. It’s Iowa – we love Iowa.
By the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I’ve been on that one too. A really great one.
The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36% and then I won’t even mention the other numbers because they’re so low.
You know, when you have so many people running – we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you’ll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don’t know. When somebody’s down at zero I would think that eventually they’ll drop out. The only difference is there’s nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you’ll be seeing that.
One of the things I think that’s so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy – so important – Trump 55%. Everyone else nothing.
On the budget – I’m really good at these things – economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump – this is with 15 people remaining – Trump 51%. Everyone else bing.
Oh, here’s one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we’re talking about today. I guess you’ve heard a little bit about it. But I’ve taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me.
You know, all of my life, I’ve heard that if you’re a successful person, especially if you have very success – you’ve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can’t run for president.
And yet, that’s the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs.
We’re being run by people that don’t know what they’re doing. Very sad.
On illegal immigration, Trump 48%. That’s with 15 people. Everyone else, no good.
On a thing called ISIS…oh, don’t worry. We’ll have plenty – we’ll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it?
Here we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people – a lot of military people here. Who’s military here? All right, I love you.
By the way, speaking of it, we’re going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody’s ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They’re never going to mess with us.




You know in many ways, it’s the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don’t know what we’re doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we’re going to make it so great, so strong that people – gosh, they’re not messing. They’re not messing.
And we’re going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We’re going to take care of them. Because they – thank you, they are not being taken care of.
We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it’s not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.
So with ISIS – Trump 46%. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running.
On foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say "Well, maybe it’s not my thing." But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that’s it.
I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn’t know what he was doing. He didn’t know why he was there. He refuses to use the term "radical Islamic terrorism". He refuses to use the term.
I don’t even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don’t.
And then we’re looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It’s just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse.
She’s got no strength. She’s got no stamina. Remember that.
You don’t need a president with no strength or stamina when we’re being ripped off on trade, we’re being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good.
When our soldiers aren’t being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today.
One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we’re the least prepared now than anytime that he’s ever seen it and he’s been there a long time retiring. That’s how we are.
In the most dangerous world we’ve ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don’t know – they don’t – I’m telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed.
Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed?
…They’d be interviewed after total and complete victory.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur. They’re not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later.
These guys – and I don’t think we’ll have to.
You know, just so you understand, Bush – Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he’ll be elected. He’s at what 3%? Right?
No, but he said some things and I was like – I said "Who says that about an opponent? You don’t say those things." You’ll find out what he said. But he said very nice things.
But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone – the tone – of Donald Trump is not nice.
And I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they’re Christian and for other reasons. They’re being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone.
Hillary said the same thing. "Mr. Trump’s tone is not nice."
These people are living in a different planet. Different planet.
And remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who’s strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things.
You know, I know a lot of tough people but they’re not smart. That’s no good. They’re easy.
We need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country.
We owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It’s a – think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word.


We owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We’re really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military.
And yet, we do deals with China where there’s a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question.
Japan – they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That’s like a loss.
You look at Mexico. We’re going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It’s gonna happen.
The people I’m dealing with – and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there’s 15 of us.
I had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they’ve all gone down. We’ve got to keep it that way, right?
I mean, Lindsey Graham. He’s at zero. He’s at zero. Zero.
Let me ask you a question. I don’t get Lindsey Graham. I don’t get him…He’s literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he’s on television all the time and he doesn’t go up. He’s at zero, folks.
His ideas are so bad. I’m more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn’t. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn’t know where the hell – ra ha.
And he always sits with John McCain. It’s like they’re the Bobbsey twins. They’re always sitting together. No, it’s true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He’s always sitting with John McCain, who’s fine. I’m not knocking it. But you got to know what to do.
Now me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament – I have a great temperament. But you’ve got to attack. If you’ve got to do something, you’ve got to know what you’re doing.
I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you’re going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me.
And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, "Fellas, you’re going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that’s what’s happening."
And Iran’s going to take over Iraq as sure as you’re sitting there.
And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left.
And we have a president – we shouldn’t have been there but then we shouldn’t have left the way we left.


You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans – wouldn’t it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do?
I’ll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we’re all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right?
…But you know, if you think about it and you’ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They’re just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren’t and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don’t agree with me; they agree with the other side.
But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we’re not vigilant – [interrupted by protester] – that was the same person. I’ve got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I’ll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don’t you get her out because honestly it’s inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up.
See, our country has this kind of security. That’s the problem we have…Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It’s one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens.
But you would think that everybody we’re all on the same basket that everybody every single person – [interrupted by protester]
…So you would think that if we could get together, we’d all be in the same boat.
Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate.
In fact, I tweeted "Is that all there is?" about the president’s speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don’t care. I don’t care.


You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn’t notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. "Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn’t know, I didn’t know, I didn’t know."
And I watched the next door neighbor saying, "Oh, well we didn’t report them because we didn’t want to racially profile or we didn’t want to profile." Give me a break. Give me a break.
We’re like the stupid country in so many different ways. It’s so – can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that’s happening with us?
They didn’t want to report them because they thought it was profiling.
Okay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn’t to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can’t put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn’t want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you’re okay, you’re innocent.
Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center – the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were…but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center.
So, what’s happened is we’re out of control. We have no idea who’s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what’s going on.
And then I looked at poll numbers and I don’t mean polls where I’m winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it’s very, very sad.
I’ll go after some of the numbers. 25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy – very highly respected group of people who I know actually.
This is people living in this country. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25%.
51% of the Muslims living in this country – by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they’re great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something’s going on, and we can’t put up with it, folks. We can’t put up with it.
51% – 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is.
So I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media – these people back here. They’re the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they’re so dishonest. They are so dishonest.
I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right ’tis the end. I had one of the politicians – Kasich – who is just getting – he’s a horrible debater…He made a statement that "Oh, they left after 10 minutes." Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody’s leaving. Nobody’s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming.
So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn’t want to do that because it’s not their thing to do.
You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don’t want to show this crowd tonight. They’re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don’t do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show – look at all the people over here. It’s a record in the history of this ship. But they don’t show it. They don’t show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It’s disgusting. Disgusting.
…And by the way, some of the media’s terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They’re totally dishonest people.


I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said "Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early." I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false.
Amazingly, there’s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She’s back there. Little Katie. She’s back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie – Katie Tur – what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they – I didn’t know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.
And then other people pick it up. You know it’s NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate.
So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don’t want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple.
It’s very simple. So here’s what happened. It’s been a little controversial. It’s been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that.
But I have more…I wish we could call – is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn’t you love that?
Now they’re coming at us in full force. They’re coming – not coming at me. They’re coming at all of us. They’re coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They’re fed up with incompetence. They’re fed up with stupid leaders. They’re fed up with stupid people.
They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who – think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I’ve seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted.
You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won’t even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he’s going to get away with nothing. He’s going to have nothing.
So he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, "I shouldn’t have done this. This isn’t working out the way I thought."
Anyways, so we get him back and here’s the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed…They get five of their greatest killers that they’ve been after – after – think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years.
So they get these – right now have gone – they’re out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I’d hate to tell you.
So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they’ve wanted for many years. That’s the way we do it.
The Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It’s called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days – 24 days – we think there’s something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it’s much longer than that because there’s a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever.
But the best is where they have the right to self-inspect. "Are you doing nuclear weapons over there?" "Oh, we’ll inspect tomorrow." "Oh no, we’re not doing nuclear weapons."
You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that’s profiling. Trust me, they’re great negotiators.
And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He’s a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible.
I always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said "You know what? I don’t think he’s going to be a good president."
I backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don’t blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, "This time I’m going to do it myself. We’re not going to lose." We’re not going to lose. We’re not losing.
And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That’s so important.


So, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it’s impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night.
And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy…
Shall I read you the statement?
Donald J. Trump is calling for – now, you’ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it’s common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25%, 51%. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen.
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice.
According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.
Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans – these are people that are here by the way, people that are here – 25% not 1%. By the way, 1% would be unacceptable. 1% is unacceptable. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part – think of that – as part of the global jihad.
They want to change your religion. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Not going to happen.
As part of the global jihad. And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51%.
Sharia authorizes – now look, this is, I mean, it’s terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won’t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look – especially women. Tough stuff.
And we have a president that won’t even mention the term and you’re talking about numbers like this.
Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it’s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension…
Where the hatred comes from and why, we’ll have to determine. We’ll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can’t live like this. It’s going to get worse and worse. You’re going to have more World Trade Centers. It’s going to get worse and worse folks.
We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it’s going to get worse and worse.
Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.
These are people only believe in jihad. They don’t want our system. They don’t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life.


…So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn’t have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn’t had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn’t had that carnage.
So important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can’t let these weak leaders diminish it.
If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. "Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom!" People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They’re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die.
Now, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn’t have guns. The bad guys had the guns.
And these young people – and I tell the press you’ve got to stop calling them "masterminds" – these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren’t masterminds.
Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris – the "mastermind". I was watching all the networks. I won’t mention who but some of them disgusted me. "The mastermind is on the loose."
And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids – they go over there. They’re young. They’re impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS.
And we have our anchors – I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don’t hear it too much. But they say "the young mastermind". Oh, he’s brilliant. Young man, he’s brilliant.
I don’t even he’s got a high IQ…In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there – mastermind – bing, bing, bing, it’s like shooting everybody. You’ve got to be a mastermind.
So the press has to be responsible. They’re not being responsible because we’re losing a lot of people because of the Internet.
And we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what’s happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way.
Somebody will "Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech". These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people.
We’ve got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They’re leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. "Oh, come on back. Where were you?" "I was fighting for ISIS." "Oh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself."
When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It’s over.
How about that? And now that they’ve become radicalized, they’re totally radicalized.
And how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn’t get women. I don’t know what the hell his problem is. It’s probably the first women he’s ever had. I don’t know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree.
Folks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.
Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what’s happening because something is happening in there. Man, there’s anger. There’s anger. And we have to know about it. We can’t be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things.
We can’t be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn’t want to tell anybody. We can’t be that.
We have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don’t worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise.


So when I started this whole quest – I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It’s been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed.
We went to Dallas – 20,000 people in Dallas. 25,000 people. Mobile, Alabama – 35,000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go – Florida – we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room – thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn’t say I exactly love doing after the first one.
But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms – all the same. I love you too. I love you…Thank you. Thank you. I love you too.
There’s an unbelievable love in all of these places – Oklahoma – 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There’s an unbelievable love. And there’s an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don’t want to be bad people. We don’t want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody.
But we can’t let people use and abuse our rights. We can’t let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can’t let it happen. We just can’t let it happen.
And I have a friend who’s a very, very successful man, and I went to one event – he came with me. We had 24,000 people. And this guy’s a real tough cookie. He’s a great financial guy. One of the guys I’d definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you’re going to be in good shape when that happens. We won’t have these characters.
You know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I’m the only one that’s self-funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I’m the only one. Only one.
I’m self-funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know.
I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, "Honestly, I can’t take it. I don’t want to do." I can’t take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money – my whole life I’ve been taking money. Now I’m sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, "So what are you going to do? I don’t want your money." And he said, "I got to go someplace else." They’re like gamblers. They’re like gamblers. But I said, "You like me best." "I like you best but I’m going to go someplace else." Because they want to be part – they want to –
…Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don’t forget, I was the fair-haired boy. I was like the establishment. They’d all come to me, and I’d give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max – bing, bing, bing.
I used to say "Senators, don’t come to my office. Anybody that’s a U.S. Senator that calls me, we’ll send you a campaign contribution."
But you know what? I’ll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS – they’re corrupt – they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won’t say Cruz because he’s been very nice to me. Nah, he’s been nice. He’s got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you.
No, I’ve been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don’t know. He’s a friend of mine but he’s not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You’ve got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what’s going on.
Does that make sense by the way? Until we find out.
And he talked about – that’s inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right?
But that’s the statement of an inexperienced man…About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced?
So Chris, who’s a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won’t do this a lot.
Look, here’s the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it.
Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they’re closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn’t get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They’re with him all the time – the people that did it.


They never said, "Hey boss, we’re closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight." No, they never said that. They’re talking about the weather, right?
He knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He’s a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don’t think so. But I don’t know. It’s called life. You’ve got to be smart in life.
I would say there’s less than 1% chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn’t mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They’d just say, "Chris, tonight we’re closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you." "Oh, okay." They didn’t mention? Nobody believes that.
Number two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It’s a disaster. I have property over there – the taxes are through – I’ll use an expression – coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades.
You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood.
I actually called. I said, "Let me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama?" I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don’t know. I think he possibly did.
And Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it.
So when Chris talks about – when he talks about lack of experience – I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said "Wow, that is unbelievable." I would have probably filed them even when I didn’t run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed.
Everybody said "Number one, he won’t run." And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, "Let’s go" to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay?
But then they said, "Oh, well he announced." So these talking heads – most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they’d say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn’t go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they’re brilliant. One’s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don’t like him.
But what happens is they say "Well, he’ll never file form A." That’s basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A.
Then they said, "Well, he’ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks." Then they said, "And if he does, he’ll ask for many, many delays because you’re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they’ll delay it until after the election."
I said, "No" so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn’t believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned.
I built a great company and the reason – honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that – low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets – Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Ave., land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over.
In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location.
And what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said "Oh, I can’t believe it."
Then they said "Well, maybe he won’t do so well with the polls." And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run.
And I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me "You know if you run you will win. Don’t you?" She’s very smart.
I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "If you don’t run, you’re never going to poll before. Nobody believes you’re going to run." So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren’t great before I announced. She said, "No, the only way you’re going to get a poll number is you’ve got to announce." Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you’re running, it doesn’t matter. Nobody believes you’re running.
So I said, "All right." I’m getting these lousy early numbers and I’m saying, "I don’t know. I don’t want to run and find out it doesn’t work." I don’t want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It’s true. It’s true.
So I said, "All right. Let’s take it."
So we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I’m telling you and you know what I’m talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, "Let’s go" to my wife.


I took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration.
And illegal immigration was such a big subject. And I’m telling you had I not brought it up, it has turned out to be – and I took heat. I took heat like nobody has ever taken heat. Rush Limbaugh said "The most incredible incoming that I’ve ever seen a human being endure". And then he doubled down a week later because I was right.
And now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things.
And then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old – think of it, 66-year-old – veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. And many, many more. It’s a huge problem.
And they take our jobs and a lot of other things.
So all of a sudden, everyone’s saying "Wow"…and from almost at the beginning, you’ve seen I’ve been at the top like from almost day one.
…The reason I tell you certain things and the reason I talk about what I’ve done and lots of good things. A little thing – Wollman ice skating rink. The city couldn’t get it built for high years. They were in there for like $20 million. They couldn’t get it done. I went to the mayor of New York, I said, "Ed Koch, I’ll get it done real quick." He didn’t like it because he didn’t want to be shown up. I said I’ll do it and if it costs more than $2 million I’ll pay for it. I got it built for peanuts. Got it done in four months. And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it.
I did another one – I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx. They were having – things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years. They couldn’t get it done. I got it done under a year. It’s operating now. It’s very successful.
It’s what I do and that’s what we need. That’s what we need in our country.
I’m building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel. One of the great hotels of the world. The Old Post Office site. Think of it. I got it in the Obama administration. Everybody was bidding. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA – general services. And I got it. Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration? Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built. So they wanted strong financials. And they also wanted a great plan. So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan. The job is under budget, ahead of schedule. It was going to open up in ’17 – sometime during the year ’17. Now, it’s going to open probably in September of ’16 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue.
And this is the kind of mindset you need.
Carl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me.
We have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore. Pfizer’s leaving the United States.
In the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina. They’d leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower. They’d leave for North Carolina. They’d leave – today they’d leave this country for other countries.
So now, we’re losing Pfizer. We’re losing many of our great companies.
We have $2.5 trillion offshore at least. And everybody agrees it should come home – the Democrats, the Republicans. For three years, they can’t make a deal. They can’t make a deal because there’s such gridlock. There’s no leadership in Washington.
We will make this country so great. We have people and I’ll tell you something. I’ll tell you something…[interrupted by protester] said something to me the other day and what I really want to do – [interrupted by protester] – what we want to do or what I want to do is I want to be the people’s president.
…Think of this, think of this, I don’t work for any of the lobbyists. I don’t work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction. We don’t.
…The best thing that I’ve seen in going around and the thing that I’ve seen more than anything else is how smart the people are. They don’t believe those people in the back that write with fork. I’m telling you, they don’t believe them. The people are really smart.
What’s giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that I’ve met – the incredible people of this country.
We’re going to make America great again. And you know what? We’re going to make it greater, greater, than ever before. And I love you all and thank you very much. South Carolina. Great. Thank you! We love you. Thank you!


Thank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I’ll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she’s very proud. The only bad news, I can’t get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can’t speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that’s okay.
It’s an honor to be with you. You know, I’ve devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven’t done what I’ve done. I’ve received many, many awards.
I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, "Don’t do it. Don’t do it." I walked up Fifth Avenue. I’m looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, "No way am I not going to do it." And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had.
So, I’m in a different position than the other candidates because I’m the one candidate I don’t want any of your money; I want your support but I don’t want your money.
I’m self-funding my campaign. It’s been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far.
I thought by this time I’d have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it.
At first, I was embarassed by that. I said, "You know, I think we’re going to have spend money just to spend money" but it’s not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It’s not even close. Every single poll, every single state.
The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire – the PPP poll – Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right?
Most of importantly, favorability – no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That’s ultimately the most important.
And you know, I’ve been a tremendous fan and I’ve been a tremendous contributor. I’ve given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job.
And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind.
In fact, I’ve been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It’s loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you.
My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they’ve been great. They have been great.
So, Obama is the worst thing that’s ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst.
And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very – I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they’re having fundraisers for Obama. I said, "What are you doing?"
And it’s almost like they answer me and they say, "We don’t know. He comes to New York. We don’t know. We don’t know." I said he’s a disaster.
I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I’m a negotiator like you folks. We’re negotiators.
We don’t build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million – can you imagine this? A small gas station – $43 million – and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don’t sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station.
How many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please?
But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don’t need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It’s true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion.
They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect.


We’re going to let them self-inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we’re all good with contracts don’t start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect.
And we don’t even get our prisoners back.
And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don’t want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three.
Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago.
And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I’m saying. It should have been you walk in – by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn’t win anything. We didn’t win anything.
But that should have been with our prisoners – day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don’t want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it’s going to look good.
And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They’re going to say, "No, we’re not giving." And we’re going to say, "Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you’re ready." And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they’re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It’s so easy.
Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen. No, he’s the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he’s one of the few. He’s one of the – biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn’t read it. And Obama definitely didn’t read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh.
But they said – this is hard to believe but this is what they said – a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don’t I end up with a – they said we didn’t want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It’s really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn’t want to complicate – so now, we’re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point.
I’d tell you this, look I’ll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They’re going to be back, I guarantee you. They’re going to be back.
Now, our president doesn’t want to use the term – we had another event, which probably was – the one yesterday – probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related – radical Islamic terrorism. And I’ll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There’s something going on with him that we don’t know about.
Now, as far as Hillary’s concerned, she’s going to go with what he wants.
She shouldn’t be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn’t be allowed to run.
She’s going to have to follow his line because she’s on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it’s very dishonest what’s going on with our government.
Gen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially – look, I don’t want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went – for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did.
And Obama, I mean, she can’t go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That’s the end of it. That’s the end of it.
So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he’s got control of her. I mean, it’s just total control.
But I’ll tell you what, she shouldn’t be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act.
And remember this, this is a six-year – you have a six year statute of limitations. So she’s fighting for her life. If she doesn’t become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody?
Because what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she’s been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it’s Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption.


She was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole – the world blew up around her. It blew up.
500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn’t respond.
The truth is she doesn’t have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we’re talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there.
But she responded – yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don’t get that.
But she responded to a friend, but she doesn’t respond to an ambassador that’s asking for help. Hundreds – hundreds of requests and she doesn’t respond.
Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd.
The other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on. 12,000 people. The convention center held 5,000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speeches…I said, "You can’t get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?" My people said, "No, this is the biggest one. We set a record – a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It’s true. Elton John. I’m no longer competing with politicians. I’m competing with the musical talent.
One of the great musicians said "You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar" meaning who doesn’t count on music.
So it’s true, we’ve had tremendous response. We’ve had incredible response.
I think you know if you look at what’s going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls – again I don’t want your money therefore you’re probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn’t want money therefore we can’t – even though he’s better than all these guys, even though he’s going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don’t know if that’s – but they said I’m the only celebrity. I don’t know. I’m not a celebrity. See now I’m a politician. I’m so embarrassed by that term.
You know, my how life I’ve been a business, I’ve been a developer. I’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company.
A lot of people said, "Oh, he’ll never file." This you’ll get a kick out of. "He’ll never run because he’ll never want to file various papers. And then he’ll never file this and that and then you’d have to sign your life away." The first paper – we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That’s the end of it. He did it.
Then they said, "Well, he’ll never sign and he’ll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he’s not as rich as people think."
So I filed my financials – almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, "Oh my, it’s much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!"
…If I didn’t run, I’d probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It’s true.
Some of the greatest assets – Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many – Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things…
And the reason I bring that up is because that’s the kind of thinking we need.
And I don’t bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that’s the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don’t know the first thing about the word negotiation.
I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they’re better than Obama and they’re better than Kerry and they’re better than the foolish people – the foolish people. It’s so embarrassing when you see what happens.
Sergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl – we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they’ve wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one.
And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him.
The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, "No, he deserted. He was a traitor." And we still made the deal.
So we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to re-negotiate deals? Some of us will re-negotiate deals. I would say about 99.9 – is there anybody that doesn’t re-negotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate – perhaps more than any room than I’ve ever spoken. Maybe more. It’s okay. I’ve been called on that a couple of times too.


But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell – they can have him even if we don’t get the five guys back because that’s not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They’re right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in.
So they get their five guys that they’ve wanted for nine years they’ve wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that’s the way our people negotiate. They’re stupid people. Okay? They’re stupid people.
It’s very sad. It’s very sad.
So I’ll just tell you that I’m going to win. I am. I’m going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I’ll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here’s a nice one, you’re number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people – talented people, great people.
But I believe I’m going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I’ve won, and my life has been about winning, and that’s what I want to do for the country.
And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest.
It’s like the other day – Ivanka, she’s doing so great. "Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, "Honey, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?" It’s amazing. See? Now I’m dealing in trillions. I’ve never heard of trillions before. You know, with this – we owe $19 trillion.
We just signed a budget that’s so bad and the Republicans – you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they’re going to end Obamacare, which I’m going to do by the way – I’m ending, I’m terminating, it’s going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they’re going to do this and they’re going to do budgets – like I heard the guy before "We’re going to work in the budget." It’s all about that. What happens is they’re going to do budgets like we’re going to do this and that and I tell this story – then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up "Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors." They’ve never seen anything like it. "We’ve arrived. This is incredible." And then they become mainstream. "We’ll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote." They don’t want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they’d get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they’ve let us down. That won’t happen with me.
So, again, you’re not going to support me even though you know I’m the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I’ll be that. I know why you’re not going to support me and you know you’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money. Isn’t it crazy? No, it’s true.
You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I’d have a damn good chance and I think I’d get more money than anybody else.
Do you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions.
I would have made – poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It’s sad. No, it’s sad.
I came up with that term, it became so defining. It’s like having it on his forehead "I am low energy". No, no, it’s sad.
He raised $125 million, which means he’s controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money.
That’s why you don’t want to give me money, okay? But that’s okay. You want to control your own politician. That’s fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don’t worry about it.
I understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who’s better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It’s true. $350,000. I didn’t receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don’t give any – why would I give any more? You don’t get a thank you letter.
Politicians – remember this – politicians forget, politicians generally aren’t competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that’s what you’re going to end up having.
But I would love your support but I don’t want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let’s take some questions. Okay? Good.


…I’m going to go there right after this. I have to go through – you know, you have to watch to make sure that the contractors aren’t stealing and ripping you off and everything else.
But to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important Israel is to me, it’s so important, I don’t mention my projects. It’s not like very important to me anymore.
What’s really important to me is the United States and making it great again.
My theme is Make America Great Again. I mean, it’s taken off like crazy. The hats – it’s going crazy.
But you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because we’re smart.
A couple of them got up. No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up – make America great again… But nobody stood up to them. But we sent them a little notice – don’t use that term. We’re trademarked.
Can you imagine I got the approval?
But we are – we’re building a great hotel down the road. I hope you all stay and it’s going to be wonderful…


…So I was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from AP and they did a very good job. Very fair story.
And one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians what’s going to happen.
I said – I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make…Can we think of any deals? We all have tough deals, right? You know, we have some good, some bad…
But I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other.
I believe – because I’m a dealmaker – I believe that I can put both sides together.
But I said, it’ll take six months. At the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct. A lot of us. And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you’re going to make a deal.
I will know very quickly whether or not I’ll be able to put that deal together.
I used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together. There’s probably no tougher deal.
If I could do that, it would make me so happy because there’s so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years.
Now, I said you have to have a commitment to make it. I don’t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.
With that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at what’s going on. So I have a good chance. I don’t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room. I don’t want one side or the other saying.
Look, I think people know where I stand. But wouldn’t it be great if they could make a deal? But a lasting deal, a real deal. Not a phony deal that’s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again.
I’d love to – and I will give it. You know Obama, as you know he said it won’t happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started.
But I think it would be a great thing for Israel – I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and I’m going to give it my best.
I’m a great dealmaker. That’s what I do. I made a lot of money. I’m going to give it my best. It would be great if that deal could be made.
…
By the way, Israel has given a lot…And a lot of people don’t know that. I think the public relations for Israel hasn’t been so great because Israel’s given a lot but hasn’t been given a lot of credit for what they’ve given…
In fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel. There were things given. But I’d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let’s go, everybody’s even, we love everybody, and let’s see if we could do something.
But I do think this – and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons I’m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot. I don’t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that’s going to be up to them. But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they’ve done. I will say that. I will say that. So that’s it.


You know what I want to do? I want to wait until I meet with Bibi. You know, I’m leaving for Israel in a very short period of time. I know. I know what you’re saying. I just – you’re not going to be – who’s the wise guy?
Do me a favor. Just relax. Okay? You’ll like me very much, believe me. Okay? And you wonder why you get yourself in trouble. All right? You’re going to like me very much. It’s going to be fine.
But again, you can’t go in with that – if you’re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can’t go in with the attitude we’re going to shove it down. You’ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone’s happy. Don’t worry about it. You’re going to be very happy. Okay? Don’t worry about it.


I think he’s a very good man. I think he’s been treated very badly. I think that our president has been unbelievably rude to Bibi. I don’t know how many people like Bibi. But I think he’s been unbelievably rude.
And – I mean, we’ll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing.
Perhaps it’ll go down – and I’ve been pretty good at predicting things. I think it’s going to go down as the worst single thing that’s ever happened to Israel. I think it’s a catastrophe for Israel.
And I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe.
I think it will be one of the great catastrophes.
But if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me. It’s going to be straightened out. It’s going to be straightened out tough and it’s going to be straightened out fast.
The one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone. That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel. But the $150 billion is gone because it’ll be gone before you get there.
You know, we’re talking about a year and more actually. Although the election very quick. You know, it’s coming up. It’s now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and it’s very exciting. We’re talking about a couple of months now for it to start.
For a person like me, I mean, it’s very exciting.


Well, I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders, to be honest with you. Okay?
You know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi. I don’t know if that’s going to help me in the negotiation. I can tell you. You know, I’m trying to keep it nice and level, right? Then I get people screaming at me. But I’m trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part don’t know.
The King of Jordan seems like a nice man. I mean, I don’t know. We’re going to see. A lot of people like him; some people don’t.
But I think I will probably be able – what my history – you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans. I get along with everybody. That’s what I was – I’m a businessperson. I get along with everybody. We have to get along with everybody.
And I took some heat and I always explained that. I said, "Wait a minute, I’m a businessperson. I’ve got to get along with everybody." I live in Manhattan. It’s all Democrat. I mean, it’s virtually all – Republicans don’t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%. You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote. Got to get along with everybody.
I think that’s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington. We have people that – they don’t talk.
You know, I remember that years ago because I’ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political.
But years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats – they used to like each other. They’d get along. They’d have dinner together. They’d argue and they’d fight and they’d disagree and would have, you know, different views and things.
But in the evening, they’d go out and they’d have dinner together with their families. You don’t see that anymore.
There’s total hatred and there’s total gridlock.
I’ll give you one point, which I think is important. Corporate inversions. Right? So you have companies leaving the United States and they’re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things. A lot of things are better. But they’re leaving. Pfizer. How good is Pfizer? Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost.
But they’re also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least – I think it’s a much higher number than that. $2.5 trillion – that’s out of the country that these companies can’t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high. They’re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out.
So they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that’s how much money.
The Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back. For three years they can’t get a deal. There’s no leadership. It’s gridlock.
There’s an example of something where everybody agrees – all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can’t get it done because they’re politicians. They’re all talk; they’re no action.
So there’s something and it’s so important. It’s not like something where they don’t get – like there’s big disputes and we understand that. This is something everybody agrees – the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things – taxes paid.
But they agree and they can’t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership.


You know, honestly, I don’t think anybody can say. She says she is. But now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she’s going very, very far over to the other side.
I mean, Bernie Sanders has brought her to positions that she didn’t want to be at. You look at some of the things that she’s saying right now.
But I’ll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn’t have the strength or the energy to help Israel. I’m telling you she doesn’t.
…But just take a look. She’ll come out and do an event and you don’t see her for another four days, three days, five days. No, it’s true.
Think of it. We don’t need – some people say it’s not nice to say. She doesn’t have the strength or the energy.
Israel needs more than just our support. They need strength. They need real power behind them.
Because you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israel’s looking more and more – you know, Israel has some difficulties.
And one thing and I think you’ll all admit it. These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think. Right? We used to think "Oh, that was easy."
15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh "Oh, don’t worry about it." Now they’re saying, "These guys are – they’re dirty fighters." And they’re not bad. You know, they’re tough. They’re not the JV. Okay? Obama said they’re the JV. They’re not the JV folks.
We need tough. We need General George Patton. We need General MacArthur. We don’t need the guys we have. I see them on television – generals. I don’t want my generals on television saying "Well, ISIS is very tough."
I saw a guy the other day. ISIS is very tough. I don’t know. I don’t need that.
Do you think General George Patton – they don’t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy. So he would never make it. They probably would have had him thrown out years ago.
But we need Patton. We need a genius like MacArthur.
And we have those people. We have those people. I’ll find that person.
But we’re going to knock the crap out of them, I’ll tell you what. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. We’re going to win.


Well, I think radical Islam right now is, and I feel that’s the greatest. And again, we have a president who refuses to use the term.
But radical Islam is – I’ll tell you one thing I know isn’t is global warming. That’s the one thing…I know isn’t.
I mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said – here they want to blow everything – this is right after Paris. They want to blow our cities up. They want to destroy our civilization, and he’s worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax.
By the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly. No, it’s true.
And you know what I want to do? I want really immaculate air. I want clean, crystal water. I want a lot of things. Okay? I want a lot of things.
But global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming, they go climate change, they go – now I hear a lot of extreme weather. How can you miss with extreme weather, right? If it’s cold, it’s okay. If it’s hot, it’s okay. If it’s windy, if it’s hot – everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what’s going on.
And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left.
Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.




…It’s a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I’ve heard about Simon and Schuster’s being a fabulous – I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You’ve given us such tremendous support.
And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It’s been an incredible experience.
We wrote a book and the title – "Crippled America" – is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we’ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth.
And America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it’s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt.
We have a military that doesn’t have proper instruction from leadership. We don’t know what we’re doing. We’re losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they’re beating us in trade.
And we can’t go on like this any longer. It’s impossible to go on like this any longer.
I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that’s not the way it’s going to work anymore.
So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it’s going to be very instructional, very important.
To me, it was instructional.
When I did "The Art of the Deal", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book "The Art of the Deal" and the other books we’ve done.
So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what’s going on right now. It’s a moment of time. And we got it done.
And David did a fantastic job…And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in.


But we see by the lines – the lines go down to Park Avenue. They’ve been forming since last night and I’m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We’re doing a couple of interviews and then we’re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that’ll be very exciting for me.
But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don’t know how they’re doing this but they do it. They find a way.
So I’m looking forward to getting to the signings.
…






Well, I think it’s a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I’m leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I’m leading big.
A poll just came out in Florida where I’m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place.
And I think you know look we’re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we’re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we’re beating – they call it the establishment. It’s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down.
But I don’t know. I don’t know how his book is doing.






Well, I think my book is very hard-hitting. His is a different kind of book and he’s a different kind of a person. My book is very hard-hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it’s selling like hotcakes. So we’ll see.






We’re very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I’m different from all of the other candidates.
Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me.
We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we’re losing with China, that’s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we’re short on with Japan.
The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that’s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally.
So I mean, much different than – you’re look at Marco Rubio – very, very weak on illegal immigration.
You look at Ben and he’s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can’t get rid of Medicare. It’d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don’t know how he stays here.






No, I think that really Marco is over-rated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn’t been able to – Marco doesn’t show up to the United States Senate. He’s representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I’m way up in Florida over everybody.
But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn’t show up for the people of Florida, and I don’t think he should be doing that.
Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush’s side and ultimately I think Marco’s going to be hurt very badly.
And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he’s coming from, I think people are going to say, "Whoa, we didn’t know that."
But look at Marco’s stance on illegal immigration. It’s really trouble for him. I don’t see how he can win.






Marco Rubio’s personal finances are discredit…All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I’ll tell you what, I love Florida. I’m in Florida all the time. And for years, I’ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that.
But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I’ve heard about it for years. You’ll have to find out.






Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his – you know, he certainly lives above his means. There’s no question about that.


…I’ll tell you what. On the debates, it’s very interesting. Because I don’t really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let’s get going. Because I don’t really care that much.
But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect – many of them, not all of them – but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn’t asked one tough question. They didn’t talk about her foundation. They didn’t talk about any of the problems. They didn’t talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign.
First of all, people aren’t going to his rallies anymore. He’s finished.
So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she’ll easily be the candidate.
But I will say this: She only got softballs. That’s all she got.
And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn’t the same way.
With that being said, I don’t really care.






Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He’s a disaster. And he was – it was such as horribly put question and so obvious.
And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it.
And all we want to do is to be treated fairly.
But with me, I don’t care that much. Just give me a podium.
What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else.
You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn’t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched. Okay? Nobody wanted to watch.
Now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people. I mean, give me a break.
So somebody said, "How did they get there?"
And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said "solely for one reason – it was Trump". I’ll take the credit.
But I’ll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they’ve ever envisioned.
CNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250,000. So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That’s what I want.






I’m giving them away. I’m giving the profits of my book – I’m giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets.






…I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women. This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn’t see that in the construction trades. I mean, it was totally unique.
I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many – a proportion that’s close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money – in many cases more than men doing the same job.
So women have always appreciated that about me. I’ve been in terms of employment really a standout and I’ve been honored for doing so well with women.






What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate? I don’t know. But he didn’t say it well.






…I like Telemundo by the way. I like it better than Univision. I’m suing Univision for $500 million.
…Because the country is doing so poorly. It’s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.








That’s good. They’re going to have some demonstrations. Oh, good because it’ll get even higher ratings if they do that. I think it’s fine. I think they should demonstrate. Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It’s going to be one of the highest rated shows ever. And they’re very excited about it.
And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics. You’ve treated me actually very fairly. Won the poll recently in Nevada. Won other polls. And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody.
So I have a great relationship with the Hispanics. I have working for me thousands right now – thousands of Hispanics. I’ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me. I’m a job machine. I’m a job machine.
And one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close. I’m two, three, and you see that – two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else.
And you’d almost say like it’s about the jobs, it’s about the economy. Then how’s anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness?
But I’ve had a great relationship with the workers. I’ve had a great relationship with jobs. And I’ve had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics. And I predict that I’m going to win the Hispanic vote.






I think I’m going to win the Hispanic vote. I predict, yeah, I think I’m going to get the nomination and I will win the White House. I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad.




That’s the question I like. How am I preparing for my SNL? Well, I’m meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while. Afterwards, we’re going to sign – I guess got thousands of people on line but we’re going to sign and then later on this evening I’m meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and we’ll start the preparation. We’ll pick our skits. Am I nervous? Not too nervous. Not too nervous. But we’re going to do a good job and we’re going have a fantastic show. We’re all going to have a lot of fun.






My Jeb impression? No, I don’t want to do that. I don’t like showing a person sleeping at the podium.






Tom is asking "Can Jeb make a comeback?" I think it’s going to be very hard. Very hard. Not about money. I just think – you know, I came up with the energy. And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track. You can’t do that when you don’t have that.
I think Marco is highly overrated. Highly overrated. He doesn’t have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things.
Jeb – he lacks the quality that you need.
We’re talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off. You need a very strong person with tremendous energy. Thank you very much folks, I’ll take the job.
But and it’s so important. And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy.
We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President.
We have a president right now that doesn’t have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he’s been a horrible president.
We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect. And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion.






From the Guardian. Ah, they treat me very nicely in Scotland. Go ahead.






Well, we just went over that. Honestly, we just went over that. And it’s only going to make it harder.






You’re going to see what we’re going to do. You’re going to see. But the whole thing with anchor babies, I turned out to be right. A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here. Now, we’re responsible for that person for the next 85 years. I don’t think so.
And by the way, I was right, they were wrong. The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that.
And if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country. You would be laughed out of the country so fast.
So, that turned out – I was 100% right. We’ll have to worry about that. We’re going to take care of it, and it’s going to be done in a very humane way.
But we’re going to bring back our country and we’re going to have a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall and you know why they’re going to pay? And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people. Phenomenal. And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands – by the thousands. Phenomenal relationships.
But let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance – $45 billion last year. Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars. They will pay for the wall. And it will be very interesting.
And you know what? People are going to come into this country but they’re going to come in legally.




…A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration.
Well, walls work. All you have to do is ask Israel. Walls work if it’s properly constructed. Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace – all talk, no action politicians – they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it.
Walls work. All you have to do is go and see Israel. They will tell you that walls work.






We need pomp and circumstance. Our country has no spirit. Our country has no gravitas. Our country doesn’t feel good about itself. And the primary reason is we have no victories. I mean, where have we had a victory? Where have we had a victory in trade? Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where we’ve given them $150 billion and we lose everything. We lose everything. It’s a laughing stock. Worst deal. Worst contract I’ve ever seen drawn.
We have no victories. And I do write about it. We need some pomp and circumstance. We need spirit. We need a cheerleader.
I thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. He’s not. He’s been a great divider for the country. He’s been one of the great dividers of all time.
I’m not saying dress. It has nothing to do with dress. It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive. He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened.






…I’ll go anyway they want. I don’t care too much about the debates. Look, I’m the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway. Nobody else gets the really nasty questions. In a certain way, maybe they’re defending me although I will tell you they’re not doing it for that reason.






I think it’s irrelevant. I just – I like the debates. I’ve had the debates. I’ve done well in the debates. As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates. Now, I don’t know if I did or not but I certainly didn’t do badly. But every single poll says – even CNBC’s poll said I won the debate.
So I like the debates. I think they’re good for me. But we have to be treated a little bit fairly.
As an example, Hillary Clinton – no tough questions. I mean, why didn’t they ask about Bill? Why didn’t they ask about all of the different things. No tough questions. Now, that was staged by the Democrats. And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it.
Well, we’re going to stage something properly also.
But as far as I’m concerned, I really don’t care that much. I just want a debate. I think debating is a good thing. It’s healthy. Gets everything into the open.
But you don’t want people like Harwood that read a question – blah, blah, blah – that he wrote – that he carefully wrote. He thought he was such – his career – in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened.
He could ask about anything you want. I mean, you have to ask about anything you want. Hillary had only softballs. All night long. It was like this – "Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park."








Are you from Russia? All right. I think our relationship with Russia will be very good. Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago. Right? Putin. And they have one of the highest ratings they’ve had in a long time. So I’m going to give him total credit. But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia.
Now, maybe we won’t. But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia. I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin.






Sounds okay to me.






Well, I think there are a lot of economic issues. We didn’t talk about trade. We didn’t talk about devaluations. Right? We didn’t talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don’t even know what it means.
But we didn’t talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country – massive companies – because they can’t get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere. So they’re leaving and they’re taking their jobs with them.
The corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about.
These were all things that weren’t talked about at the debate. Instead, they talked about fantasy football. I mean, it was a big question – fantasy football. I’m saying what about corporate inversions? $2.5 trillion at least. I think it’s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can’t get the money back to invest in this country.
So they don’t talk about corporate inversions at the debates. They talk about fantasy football. Those are the few.






I was against the war in Iraq. You know, it was very early on. I’ll give it to you. Yeah, I have it upstairs…
Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn’t care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That’s exactly what’s happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I’ve felt that for a long time.






…Do I think that it’s time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero – in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because that’s less than zero. I assume that’s not happening. Do I think it’s time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out? Yes. There are too many people. Well, I don’t want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers.
Look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they’re at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out.
Like, you know, look at me. I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida. 37%? Georgia. I mean, those are real numbers. These numbers that these people have – and I often ask myself. I asked Mark yesterday, "What are they doing? Do they do this for their brand? Because I happen to think it’s very bad for their brand."
I think [Scott] Walker did a good thing. I think the way Walker – he saw it wasn’t happening, wasn’t going to happen and he just got out quickly. You know, he was favored. Don’t forget. You know. That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win.
What happened is he got out.
I think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself.
And frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems. So it’s a great question. People should get out.








Ivanka. Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines – it’s true – I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka. She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is great…But Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon. They’re going to be coming out very soon.






Oh, Ivanka is going to Iowa. When are you going to Iowa? Very soon.






I would say – I don’t see threats. I mean, whatever it is I have to do. Mark is saying "What are the top threats to your candidacy?" Who knows? I mean, you’re in the crazy world of politics. People change their minds.
I’m going to make America great again. Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I’m going to do it.
I’m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that’s awfully tough to compete with.
And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there – I showed some of the developments that – I have many, many more because you can only – Simon and Schuster – you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it’s even better but we didn’t have that certified yet.
So I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that’s the kind of thinking our country needs right now.
We are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words – I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don’t believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership.
There are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn’t? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven’t done anything. Right? They can’t even get along when they agree.
So here’s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can’t do it. That’s a part of the problem.






Well, you’re going to look – a lot of controversy with Mr. Singer. A lot of controversy with Mr. Singer. There are those people that probably wouldn’t have want him to back. But we’ll see. I’ll talk to you.






No, they all agree. They all agree. They just didn’t want to go through the unfair questions because they weren’t questions; they were statements.
You see, they were asking – they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way.
And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC.






…The question is should the Fed raise rates? They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them. In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen. And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and she’s not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn’t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration. Janet Yellen should have raised the rates. She’s not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn’t want her to. And if she does it, you see what happens every time there’s even a thought of raising them just a little bit.
And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know how to say to China, "Don’t do that. Don’t do that. Because if you do that, we’re going to put a big fat tax on you. Don’t do that." And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn’t do it. If you have the right messenger…






I’m really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections. I’m not watching any of them in particular. I’ll be watching them on Tuesday night. But I’ll be out there; we’ll be out voting.
But the election that I’m watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we’ve ever had in this country. We’re so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership.






That’s a good question. Okay. So, Simon and Schuster came up to me. They wanted to do a book. They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that’s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country. And I said, "I’ll do it but we have to talk about the country."
What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some great…photos. I’m smiling. I’m happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It’s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you’re talking about "Crippled America" and you’re talking about all of the problems we have, I can’t have a big smiley face up there. So that’s how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me.
I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn’t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me. Okay?






Are the other Republicans afraid to debate? Well, some of them should be.
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.


…I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we’d do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What’s happened all over. What’s happened in Iowa. It’s been really incredible.
We’ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in.
Got a little shake-up in Iowa. I don’t know what’s going on.
Somebody said "Are you going straight to New Hampshire?" Now, I love New Hampshire. We’ve got great numbers. 38 to 12. That’s good.
But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds.
Everybody said and it’s very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they’d have like 50 people and they wouldn’t need this room. Believe me.
But everybody said without question in every poll – this isn’t just here – that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don’t go anywhere. They’re staying. It’s true. I see it. I see it.
And we’ve seen it.
You know, a couple of times I say "Well, that could be the end." Then they do something and I’m 10 points up. It’s the craziest thing, right? But we’ll take it.
But they say the people are with – we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it.
The other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don’t you think? Leadership.
I mean, when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot.
So you know it’s great.
I thought I’d talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right?
We have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it’s always tough when you’re on live television all the time.
Look, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics?
The bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you’re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you’re talking about immigration and you’re talking about the wall because we’re going to have a wall and we’re going to stop illegal immigration.
But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about.
But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it’s really about results. Isn’t it? It’s really about results.
And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways.
I talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we’re losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples.
But it’s still going to be a certain number of subjects.
I talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments.
You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. At least with me it’s not going to happen. That I can tell you.
So I said today you know we’ll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we’re going to have some fun. We’re going to do that.
A few things – I want to bring up a few new subjects.
So, immigration, we’re going to be doing a very strong number. It’s killing us. It’s killing us. And it’s bad for the economy. It’s bad for – all of this illegal immigration.


And I have to tell you legal – you come in and we’re going to have a good time and you’re going to be there and you’re going to do great – and visas – maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we’ll do something, we’re not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We’re going to make our economy much, much stronger.
But we’re also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We’re going to get jobs. We’re going to get jobs.
But the illegal immigration – you know, I did this and I made my determination – I took a deep breath. Because I’ll tell you what, it takes courage to say I’m going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it.
I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again… Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again.
All of these incredible places that I have.
But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you’re putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody’s done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it.
Now at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don’t we agree? It’s getting ridiculous.
Because like tomorrow night we’re having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long?
Hillary’s debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was – oh – it was – you couldn’t watch it.
You have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he’s not going to win. Just so you understand…He’s not going to win and neither is she…
Well, she’s being totally protected because in theory she shouldn’t even be allowed to run. She’s being protected.
It’s a tough game and it’s a nasty game but she’s being totally protected.
But she’s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O’Malley. So he’ll be out quickly, I guess. I don’t know what’s he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero.
And I wouldn’t say it against our folks. But they’ve treated me – some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points.
And you know what? I’m not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that’s hit me so far has gone down. They’ve gone down. And they’ve gone down bigly.
And a couple of the ones and zeroes – they’re the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they’re like desperate people. But they hit.
One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don’t understand. What does it mean? I assume it’s a typo but maybe not.
But when you look at the things that are happening with our country – the trade situation with not just China – I talk about China all the time because that’s the main abuser, that’s the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it – $400 billion a year.
And they send stuff over here but we can’t send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax.
A friend of mine can’t get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax.
Somebody bought an airplane in China here. Can’t get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can’t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he’s now selling in this country because China won’t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax.
I won’t even tell you what the tax is. It’s so astronomical that I don’t even believe them myself. So I’m not going to say it because those guys will say "Well, he was wrong." All I can tell you is it’s a massive tax. Like you don’t buy planes here because if you do, you won’t be able to get them back in.
And here, we accept all of their products.
So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China.
We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan.
We have a – you know, with all that’s going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer – a relatively small ship – over there, I don’t know if I’d want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they’re being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen.


But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they’re smarter, sharper, more cunning.
The leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They’re taking so many of our companies.
Even Nabisco – my Oreos – they’re taking Nabisco. Right? I’m never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don’t want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back.
But I’m not happy. They’re leaving Chicago and they’re moving their big plant to Mexico.
So when you see this happening, we have to stop it.
And I’m not going to beat around the bush and "Oh, let’s talk and let’s be nice and let’s say – " Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody.
We can – I’m not saying I’m perfect because I’m not perfect. Nobody’s perfect…
Now, nobody’s perfect. But I’ll tell you when it comes to that stuff I’m really – there’s nobody better.
Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He’s one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he’s not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they’re doing. He understand.
You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on.
Corporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now. They can’t get it in.
And everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They’ve agreed for years. They can’t make a deal because they have no leader.
It’s not like "Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else."
Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I’m friendly with all of them. I’m friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody.
You know, everybody says "Oh, you won’t be a unifier". I’ll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier?
But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? "You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything’s going to be great." Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn’t have done it.
But when you look at what’s happening with corporations and the highest tax – we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country – but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can’t get their money back.
And the reason is bureaucracy. It’s very hard.
And also big reason the tax is too high. They don’t want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax. They’d rather leave it over there.
And if they bring it back, they’ll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen.
I happen to believe it’s more than $2.5 trillion.
But here’s the thing and I use it because it’s so incredible. Here’s the thing. It’s not controversial. It’s not like you have the Republicans here and you have – everybody agrees. They’ve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years. They can’t make a deal.
And now what’s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States – two reasons – lower taxes but also to get their money. They’ve got billions of dollars overseas. They’re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax.
And you’re talking about one company I know of – I don’t know how much they’ve written about it – but you’re talking about 6,000 jobs just one company. You’re talking about potentially thousands of companies.
And I say it, in the old days, they’d leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they’d move to Texas or they’d leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they’d move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That’s what’s happened.
In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it’s a different world out there.
And there’s no loyalty. They’re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they’d like to move back to these countries.
They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don’t mind. They don’t have loyalty to the United States.
So my plan, my tax plan, is something I’m very proud of. We’re going to solve corporate inversion.
I’ll tell you what, we will have that money back – if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody.


Honestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don’t even know about it. It’s not their wheelhouse. Okay? It’s not their thing. It’s not their thing.
Their thing is getting re-elected. That’s what they’re good at. They get re-elected. And they make promises and they’re all talk and they’re no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It’s always the same.
So we have so many different things and what I’ve done with our tax plan, which something I’m very proud of, we’ve brought it down to a few groups.
Because right now, you have to go out – people who aren’t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They’ll pay $500, $1,000 because it’s so complicated.
And we’re going to make it nice and simple.
And we’re getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we’re getting rid of it. They don’t love me so much anymore. But I don’t care.
And we’re getting rid of a lot of things.
So we’re going to have a nice simple tax return.
Somebody said "Oh, why isn’t everybody paying?"
You know, 40% – a big percentage – will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly.
They said – well, I won’t use the candidates’ name because I don’t want to insult any candidate when they can’t defend themselves. They said "We want everybody to pay at least something." And I said, "I agree."
Here’s the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you’re talking about millions and millions of returns. You’re talking about building the IRS even bigger and it’s a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you’re talking about is far less than the administrative costs.
So I said, "I agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it’s too much. Most of these people aren’t paying anyway."
What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan.
I was in Los Angeles. Ships – the biggest ships you’ve ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing.
The balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes.
See, what our people don’t know and only somebody that wrote "The Art of the Deal" or does this stuff. It’s natural. It’s like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he’s just better. And you have athletes – very few – but there are some people that have a certain ability.
A lot of people don’t even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China.
You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5 – think of this – trillion. $1.5 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It’s a magic act. For them not for us. For us it’s a horror show.
It’s going to end. It’s going to end.
And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators – I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I’ll be honest with you. I don’t care. Do you care if they’re horrible people? Who cares?
Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he’s a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he’s built a fortune. He doesn’t want money. He doesn’t want to say, "Oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money." He wants to do it. He’s proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it’s so easy for him.
For instance, if I say "Carl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we’re losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair." I don’t have to give him a big speech. I don’t have to give him a big speech.
I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it’s going to be our benefit.
But think of it, if we’re losing that kind of money – that imbalance. It’s an imbalance. Some people will say "That’s not really a loss." It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that’s a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn’t sleep.


If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right?
But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you’re talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen.
And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they’ll have 75% and maybe they’ll like them better. Maybe they’ll be better. And they’ll be manufactured here.
Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television – other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan.
But South Korea – LG, Samsung. I don’t get bids from American. I’d love to. I’d love to.
George Will said there’s a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I’d like to have a good name too by the way. It’s important. You know, when somebody’s paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it’s nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree?
Well, it’s a company in South Carolina but they don’t make them there; they assemble them. They’ll order parts that come in and they’ll assemble them. But much different.
But I’d love it if we made them.
But you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don’t talk about him.
We made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst.
These are the people that represent – these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, "You shouldn’t say stupid. It’s not nice." But it’s true. They’re stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don’t know is there something going on that we don’t know about?
Think of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We’ve given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don’t have to develop – I was telling somebody they don’t have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it.
What the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they’re going into Syria. They got so much money. They’re a terrorist state. They’re going into all of these different places. We’re fighting them in Yemen and yet we’re making a deal with them.
So why don’t you say "Hey, Yemen out"? Our prisoners – I want them back. I want them back. I don’t want them over there. I want them back.
And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I’m the right messenger. You know, I’ve gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It’s terrible. Right? Because I can’t be so nice and say "We can all do a wonderful job". People can’t do those kind of stuff.
For instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we’re going to build a wall. It’s going to be a real wall. We’re going to have people come through and they’re going to come through legally. Or they’re going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it.
And we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don’t want to say no.
But we have at least 11 million – you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we’ve been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be 50 [million]…
But we have to get them out. We have to – look, it’s harsh.
Dwight Eisenhower – we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right?
I go remember he got elected – "I like Ike". How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we’re going to find ourselves a Patton and we’re going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We’re going to find ourselves a Patton…But we’re going to find a Patton and we’re going to find a MacArthur. And I’m really good at that. We’re going to find great people.
And I’ve told this story where I watched these generals go on television – they shouldn’t be on television. They shouldn’t be talking. You know? They shouldn’t be talking. They should be doing.


And they asked a certain general, I’m not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here’s general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what’s he doing on television? And he’s saying "Well, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out."
By the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said "Take the oil"? Always take the oil! They’re being funded by the oil that I said take.
I don’t want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn’t do it.
We shouldn’t have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn’t have been there.
We totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it.
But we were there. Then Obama announces because he’s so predictable "We are leaving on a certain date in a year."
Right? I couldn’t believe. I was sitting there thinking "Did he really say that?"
He said "We will have all troops out by a certain date." Right? Did he say that?
I said "No, no, tell me please."
…Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I’ll be the best in the military because they say I – you know, I always say I’ll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that.
But you know what I’ll be? I’ll be the great at the military. I’ll be so good. And I’ll know when – and I’ll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody’s going to mess around. We’re never going to have to use it. We’re never going to have to use it.
And I’m going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they’re our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I’m going to take care of our vets.
So go back. So the world is unpredictable.
I made a business deal a year ago. And the guy – oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That’s my own problem. I guess. But to me it’s like a painting when you could do something like that.
So I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don’t call this guy. They ended up calling this guy "What do you think about Trump?" And he said but in a respectful way, he said "He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don’t know what the hell he was going to do." That’s a positive. That’s a positive.
I mean, if you’re a poker player and you’re predictable, you’re not going home with much money. Okay?
But it was really – I said, "That’s not nice what he said." First, I said "That’s not nice. I’m unpredictable." Then I said, "Wait a minute. He meant that as a compliment." And I called him. I said, "What did you mean by that?" He said "I think that’s the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles."
So with Obama, when he announces that we’re leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn’t have been there but once you announced the bad guys – you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, "Hey, what do we have to get killed for?" I mean, these people don’t mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said "If we don’t have to, let’s not." So they moved back.
And they said, "Hey, they’re leaving in -" What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. "We will have all troops out. I’m a great president."
So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, "Oh, you’re leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let’s go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he’ll change his mind and stay. So let’s let him think he has this great victory with the surge." Right? "The surge worked!"
What happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, "Let’s wait."
Now we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That’s what happened. That was the surge.
Everybody talk so much – "Oh, the surge was so great." The surge was great because everybody knew – they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush.
I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, "Let’s get them out." Everybody wanted to leave.
Now, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won’t even say.




People say, "Mr. Trump, what’s your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where?
I say "You know, I don’t want to talk – I have a real chance of winning. I don’t want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don’t really want to tell you."
I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let’s face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it’s got flaws.
But you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say – although some people – I see it here – some people say "We love that. We love that." But when I give that answer, some people say "Oh, Trump doesn’t know. He doesn’t know. He didn’t give an answer as to exactly what he’s going to do. Exactly what he’s going to do."
And I know exactly what I’m going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, "You know, here’s the problem. If I don’t give the answer, I’m not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don’t give the answer, I’m not going to win." They’re going to say "Trump wouldn’t give us the answer."
They don’t know it’s unpredictability. They don’t know it’s strategy.
And I said for a period of time like a month, I said "I don’t want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I’ve been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we’re doing well."
Iowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job.
First of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that.
And I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don’t know what I did.
But I am a great Christian. I’m a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date – I won’t tell you what date it was because possibly you’d think I’m younger than that. But she didn’t want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her.
So cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, "You know – "
By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition?
Do you think these guys – I’m not going to say Carson – I’m not going to say Rubio, who really is way down – I mean, I am second. It’s not like it’s terrible. But I don’t like being second. Second is terrible to me.
But do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they’d come into your office. I’ve made many deals with China. I’ve had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There’s no "Hello. How are you? It’s a wonderful day." They come in – "We want deal." There’s no games. I do this for a living. I’m really good at it, folks. Really good.
And you know, when you talk about energy, I’ll tell you one thing, everybody agrees – oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I’m going to make the best deal for you folks. I’ll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You’re going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We’re going to have numbers are going to be so good.
I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning.
We don’t win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever?
We lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody.
We lose with trade.
When are we going to come back and say, "We beat China" on a deal? When are we going to come back, "We beat Japan"?
Do you know that everybody said "Oh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars."
They have no power. If we ever say, "Listen, if you’re not going to treat us fairly, we don’t want your cars anymore", they’d go out of business, folks, they’re gone.
Same thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, "Oh wow, we can get away with this and it’s going to make it impossible."
Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they’re not getting stuff out because everybody – Japan and China in particular – is devaluing their currency. That’s their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we’re making doesn’t even cover it. That’s their number one weapon and the trade that we’re making doesn’t cover it.


So I only say this and you know what? People might say "It’s terrible. He’s a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I’m going to vote for him anyways." Okay, that’s fine. I’m actually a nice person.
I always say this – nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I’m running against. They’re wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares?
I was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn’t even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It’s not their thing.
And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we’re being eaten alive.
That’s why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren’t working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It’s not 5.3%. That was done for politicians so they’d look good. It’s not 5.3%. How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people?
You look for a job. If you’re a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there…but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can’t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It’s the most ridiculous thing.
We have a tremendous – tens of millions of people in that position. They can’t find jobs. They’re good people. They want to work. They can’t. But it’s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good.
So let me just before we talk some questions, I’m going to talk about something I’ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It’s called Super PACs.
It’s one of the great scams of all time. It’s one of the great scams.
So we sent out – I think I had – and it’s not me. People set them up. And I don’t know. Maybe they’re setting up for my benefit.
Let’s take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don’t talk to him. I don’t do anything.
I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don’t even know. They’re all over the place. Trump, Trump – one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book.
They have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don’t know.
And we aren’t supposed to call them or anything. Okay.
So, we wrote a letter – a legal letter – to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don’t want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that’s having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he’s going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not.
So we sent them a – it’s a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It’s a disgrace that we have. A disgrace.
And I’ll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he’s paying a lot of money and that’s not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they’re paying – now think of it, who pays – the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I’m telling you it may be off but you all know it’s a lot.
I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune.
I know in Romney’s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It’s better than being a real estate broker.
For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.
Now, in Ben’s case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses.
In the case of Jeb Bush, you’re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They’re not supposed to be coordination. They’re not supposed to be talking. They’re right next to each other. And that’s nothing compared to what some are doing.
It’s a scam and it should be stopped. And it’s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money.


And what happened and I haven’t talked about this before but I’m seeing what’s going on. It’s horrible what’s going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall.
And this is a wall too. Won’t be as good as the one I’m going to build but it’s a wall.
But it was a wall and they didn’t deal.
I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I’m sure they never talk. I’m sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I’d say 100%. I’d say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever.
They’re not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that’s the way it works.
And in some cases, I hear in Ben’s case, I hear in other cases, they’re literally running.
I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they’re all doing. That’s why he’s out of the race because he couldn’t figure it out.
The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They’re all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don’t want to get advertisements. We don’t want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don’t even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They’ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they’ll say "What a horrible thing he just said. I think we’re going to support somebody else." They could do that.
But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing.
I feel it’s very unfair. I feel it’s a very unfair situation.
Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything…But what are they doing with this whole thing?
And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest.
But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates – some more than others. Some are unbelievable.
And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You’ll be amazed. I mean, it’s so little.
Bush, it’s the same thing.
And I’ll go over – there are other names. I know every one of them. But it’s a horrible thing that’s taking place.
And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they’re not even going through the motions. They’re not even going through.
And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, "I want an endorsement." I don’t know if they’ll give me an endorsement. I’ll tell you if they don’t they’re not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere – I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it.
When we can. By the way, it’s a great company. It’s a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don’t have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can.
But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it’s crooked stuff. It’s crooked stuff. And it’s got to stop.
And it’s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you’re supposed to do it, including me. I think I’m the only one that’s self-funding. I’m the only one putting up my own money, other than – I know it’s precious – people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100. I don’t want their money. But if you send it back it’s totally insulting.
I mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters – "Mr. Trump, I can’t afford much and I know you don’t need it but I’m sending $50 because that’s so important what you’re saying about the country." It’s beautiful.
I mean, I’ve seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there’s no letter I can write that’s not going to be insulting to those people, really. "Dear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don’t need your money and thanks a lot but we’re going to do it ourselves." If I got that back, I’d say "Who the hell does he think he is?"


So we take that and it’s something that I think is important.
So I always preface it by saying I don’t consider that funding but I’m self-funding my campaign and I’m getting ready to put up millions, millions.
And something I’m very proud of that I think it’s great and it’s you know really great, it hasn’t gotten very much publicity, hasn’t gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don’t know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around…But I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I’m number one.
Now, until Iowa came along, I said "every poll", and then Iowa – what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know?
I’m telling you. They said, "Why don’t you skip Iowa?" They told me that. Everybody said "Skip Iowa". All of the political geniuses.
A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He’s actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won’t say that. But he is. He’s a great reporter.
And he said, "Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you’d go to South Carolina" where I’m leading by massive – yeah, you’ve got to see the rallies there. They’re incredible.
"But you’d go to New Hampshire. You’d go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC."
I said I can’t do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we’re going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it.
And I don’t want to skip Iowa. I think we’re going to do well. I think we’re going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I’m going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I’m the real deal.
So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that.
So could we do – and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I’m going to win, I’m telling you we’re going to win New Hampshire, and we’re going to win South Carolina.
A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll.
But we’re going to go on and we’re going to win. We’re going to win.
And actually, one of the pundits – because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said "He’ll never run. He’s not going to run." They’re still trying to recover.
But one of the very smart one says "If Trump wins Iowa, it’s over." It’s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great.
And I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that’s the end of that.
But I want to tell you, will you – I refuse to say "Get your asses in gear." I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don’t want to use anything that’s even a little bit off.
So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory?
And if I win Iowa, we’re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we’re going to have such a great military and we’re going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that’s a nightmare.
So, I’m sticking with you people. I’m going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I’m going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it’s so important. And you know, it’s about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last – right?
So, I love you all. I mean, we’re having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I’m going to stay here. We’re going to work really hard.
When I heard the poll today, they said "What are you going to do?" I said, "I’m going to work harder in Iowa." I’m not leaving Iowa. I’m not leaving Iowa.
Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you.
Okay, let’s do a couple of questions. Right? Come on.


…You know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.
Now, you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness. But still, we have 50 million. We have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps. 46 million. Think of it. You know, we talk about how well we’re doing.
So we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it’s got to end.
One of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country. It’s very simple. You know, it’s so simple when you think about it.
Our jobs have been taken away.
And I’ll tell you what else, middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years. People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago. And other things have gone up. So they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago.
But that’s an amazing stat.
But people – one of the reasons they say I’m doing so well because I let people know we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re going to bring industry and plants. We’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that. We’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working.
Then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs. I have some people that I know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place. All of a sudden they’re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they’re working for, and now all of a sudden they’re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare. And you all know what I’m talking about.
So they end up being part-time workers and they don’t want to be part-time workers. They don’t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker. And we’re not going to have that stuff anymore. We’re not going to have it any more.
We’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up. Believe me. The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame


…Tell you what, as President, I can guarantee it. As Trump, I can say I’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop. It’ll be easier to take Todd and just say, "Look, we’re going to work with you, Todd. Okay?" So will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here? You have problems with the VA also, huh? Terrible?
I hear only – I just hear terrible. And we’re going to solve that problem. You know, it can be solved.
The waits now for the VA are longer than they’ve ever been…The waits now are worse than they’ve ever been. Thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor. Okay, dying.
And you find the same thing, you say. You have to use your own because they won’t do anything.
So we’re going to take care of our vets and we’re going to take care of the VA and it’s going to be one of the things we’re going to be releasing pretty soon.
But one of the things we’re going to do with the VA, we have a lot of hospitals that aren’t doing any business. We have a lot of private doctors that could do more business.
We’re losing a lot of our doctors because of Obamacare. They’re retiring. They’re leaving.
One of them – a friend of mine – said "I have more nurses working for me now more than before but I have more accountants" and the end result is a disaster; he’s getting out of the business. He’s got nurses but he’s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy.
So one of the things we’re going to do is if Todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the waits are unbelievable – 5, 6, 7 days sometimes. They’re going to a private doctor. They’re going to go to a private hospital. Or a public hospital that’s in the area. And we’re going to pay for that and it’s going to cost less money – it’s going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you’re going to end up getting much better care. It’s going to cost less and you’re going to get better care…


So the Keystone Pipeline, first of all, I’d approve it because it’s thousands of jobs. Okay? I would approve it so fast, so fast.
And Hillary should have approved it.
You know, Hillary wanted to approve it but she’s been dragged so far left, that’s she’s – forget it. It’s a disaster.
So I would approve it.
But with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what? We’re bringing oil from Canada. Right? I may say, I want 10%. We’re going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%.
Because the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy. And it’s great stuff.
We have really great quality, higher than Canada. You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them. Very expensive to get it out.
We have great stuff. So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it. I love the jobs of building it.
But I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land. You know, maybe we should do that.
So I’m going to look into that. But when I approve it – I’ll tell you what, when I approve it, it’ll be a great deal for the United States. It won’t be like – because right now, what we’re doing is we’re approving it, we’re not really getting anything. They’re putting it underground, and that’s actually good environmentally. Better than having trucks going down the road and everything else. That’s good environmentally. But we’re not getting – we’re not getting – anything much for it.
When I get finished with the Keystone, they’ll be happy and we’ll be happy. Okay?


Well, I’ll tell you in all fairness, Ben Carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish Medicare. Okay? And you know what a disaster that is. Now, I’m sure at some point, he’ll take it back. But he said he wants to abolish Medicare and one thing, people do like their Medicare; they do like it.
And you are bringing up a point that I’ve heard before. We’re going to look at a lot of different things.
But we’re going to save Social Security, we’re going to save Medicare and that’s the way it is. Okay? We’re not abolishing like other people.
 
Okay, it’s a lot of people but you know what? It’s costing us $200 billion a year immigration in this country right now.
And Dwight Eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out.
We have tremendous illegal immigration problems. Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States. And you know what happened? He moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back. They moved them a third time, they came right back.
And then you know they were tougher in those days. They moved them all the way south – all the way south – and they didn’t come back.
Now, we have to do it. We have no choice. We either have a country or we don’t.
And I want them to come back. But I want them to come back with papers. I want them to come back legally. I want them to come back. The good ones. The good ones. But only the good ones.
We got some bad ones. Remember the heat I took with illegal immigration? Remember that heat? For two weeks. Rush Limbaugh said "He has received more incoming than any human being I’ve ever seen." And then he double-downed…
You know what? I took a lot of heat and then you had Kate in San Francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others. And people started looking.
And let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and they’re here illegally but they’re wonderful people. Okay? And we’ll try to get them back real soon and we’ll do it through a legal process.
But we also have some really bad gang members. You know, some of the gangs in LA. They’re made up of illegal immigrants.
And we have unbelievable police forces that don’t get the respect that they should get. They don’t get it. I mean, what they go through, it’s unbelievable. They’re afraid to talk to anybody. They don’t want to lose their jobs. They don’t want to lose their pensions. They can’t talk.
Now, let me just tell you something. You can always have bad apples. In this room, we have a couple of bad apples. Okay? I don’t know who they are or where they are but you do. Probably mostly back there in the press.
But the police do an unbelievable job. And they know the gangs. You go to LA the LA cops. You got Chicago, the Chicago cops. These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs. But they’re not allowed to do their jobs.
And we’re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they’re not coming back and I don’t want to put them in our jails because I don’t want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years. I don’t want them in our jails. We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails. I don’t want them in our jails.
I heard a couple of these candidates saying, "Well, they’re – " They’re such babies.
But you know what? They’re talking about putting them in jail. Well, I don’t want them. Our jails are over-brimming. I want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there. Okay? And I don’t want to put these really bad dudes – I mean, they are bad – I don’t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years. Okay?
And we’re going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people. But we’ve got some real bad ones and they’re out of here. Your head will spin probably.
Somebody said the other day, "What’s the first thing you’re going to do?" Well, we’re going to work immediately on repealing Obamacare.
You know, the one good thing about executive orders? The one good thing? You know, Obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in. Come in.
We have great border patrol people. I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border. They’re great people. They’re not allowed to do their job. They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them. They want to do their job; they’re not allowed to.
So the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders. They’ll be revoked. The only good thing.
It’s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that’s the end of that.
So we’re going to clean up our border. We’re going to make it fantastic. We’re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen.


We will support Israel 1,000%.
Israel feels so left alone and I know BiBi and a lot of my friends are from Israel and they feel so left out.
And so many people say, you know, I have so many Jewish friends where they say why did I support Obama? I think he’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to Israel. And we will support Israel beyond anything they ever have before. Okay?
That’s an easy one. That’s the easiest question of the night!


 
…The wall is a big factor. 60%, 70%. The drugs are a great question.
We are going to stop drugs.
Look, I told you before – Mexico – $45 to $50 billion. That’s not including the drugs. The drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief.
Did you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks? Did you see the picture? They think we’re playing games.
And Mexico is not helping us. Mexico is not helping.
Do you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico – I love the Mexican people. I have many Mexican people and Hispanics working for me. In Nevada, I’m number one. I’m rated number one in the polls with the Hispanics. Everyone’s shocked.
Because the Hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know I’m going to bring jobs and everything else. They don’t want people pouring in.
But I will tell you Mexico has got to help us.
You know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico…do you know it’s one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of? And yet, people pour right through into us, into us. They call us the dumb Americans. That’s what they call us because of our leaders. They call us the dumb Americans.
If you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, you’re not going to do it. They don’t do that.
And if you’re there illegally and if you overstay your bound? You’re not going to be there illegally. But if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you. They have police that say, "You know you have one day left." I hear it’s unbelievable. I’m impressed actually. Because to a certain extent, that’s the way it’s supposed to be.
But if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it’s impossible. They don’t have anchor babies in Mexico. You’re born a baby in Mexico, it’s like bye-bye.
Here, you’re born over here, "Oh, congratulations we’re taking care of the baby for 85 years." Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. No, it’s not going to happen.
By the way, this is important, I sort of lucked into this one. The 14th Amendment. It says right there – you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, it’ll take many years, you have to go through every state. You have to do another amendment. It’s wrong. 14th Amendment covers it.
And some of the best legal minds in the world say "Trump is right." I said, "What? I am? I didn’t know." I lucked into it. Every once in a while you luck.
The fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, we’re not responsible. Now, we may have a court case but we’re going to win it. And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it. And a lot of people didn’t know that. Okay?
And the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that. How could it be possible? And we’re one of the only countries where that takes place.
And honestly, I use Mexico as an example because they’re so tough. If that happens in Mexico, they don’t even know what you’re talking about. What are you talking about? But with us? No good. Not going to happen anymore.


 
Well, you know, the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care, when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about Social Security.
Our politicians live by a different standard and I think that shouldn’t happen. And some of them tried to do it.
You know the story in Obamacare, they don’t have to take it. They live by a different standard. And that’s not going to happen. Everybody’s going to live by the same standard. They’re going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room. That’s the way it’s going to be.
 
It’s a good question. But do you know if I answer that question, we’d have a big, big story. You know that, right?
You know, I’ll tell you, it is a question that’s asked a lot.
I know a lot of good people. A couple of people on the stage that I really respect, I’ve gotten to respect.
But the truth is too early. I like to get things done first. We’ve got to close the deal. I don’t want to think about it.
There are a lot of good people. There are a lot of good people. We’ve got to close the deal. We’ve got to get it done. And to get it done, I want Iowa.
So good luck everybody. Thank you very much. I love you. I love you. Thank you. And we’ll be back. Thank you.


So, we’re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again.
It’s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again.
Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet.
This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business.
It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction.
It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn’t seen for decades.
And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit.
But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we’ve got to make our economy strong.
Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven’t seen in a long time.
We’re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%.
If you’re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 – so, very important. If you’re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you’ll not pay any income tax – nothing.
This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty.
It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax.
It ends the death tax. It’s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax.
It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich – in other words, it’s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true – while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly.
It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I’ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest.
So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital.
Changes for business – now, so important, because it’s all about business. It’s all about jobs.
We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can’t work.
So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount – 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
Now, it’s called corporate inversion. It’s a huge subject.
I’ve been watching politicians now for years – all talk, no action politicians. I’ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.


The number is probably $2.5 trillion.
Everybody agrees it should come back – Republicans, Democrats, everybody.
They can’t make a deal. They don’t know how to go about making a deal.
The reason companies aren’t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn’t make sense to bring it back.
And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They’re leaving our shores to go and collect their money.
They’re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons – the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can’t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in.
It’s called leadership.
We will have that money brought back in.
As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can’t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We’ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can’t get it back in.
So the money stays in other countries and that’s what happens. Not good for us.
The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something – and I’ve been watching it for a long time – everybody agrees to.
We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes – many of them actually – and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income.
The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don’t make sense, and which are unfair are gone.
And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense.
So we are going to give you – we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we’re going to hand them out right now to the press.
And I think you’ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair.
It’s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more.
Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer.
But I actually believe they’ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we’ll have something very special.
Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what’s going on in this country.
If you look at what we’re doing and the money we’re spending. I read where a washer – you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer – to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there.
And there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money.
We will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved.
We’re reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country.
We won’t be losing anything other than we’ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be.
So, this is a plan that’s simple, that’s a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We’ve already had some very good reviews.
I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say "Why hasn’t this been done before?"
And this is my wheelhouse. That’s what I do well.
The economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won’t say that.
So, if anybody has – [applause] – thank you. That’s amazing. That’s some of the press was actually clapping. I’ve never saw – I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.
All right. Why don’t we take some questions from the press?


 




No, I’m not going to do that yet but we have their approval. But we have some of the top people in the country worked on this.
 




Well, we’re looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%. We’re going to have growth that will be tremendous.
And by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular.
And one of the things that they don’t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting. There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I’ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the – and we’re not even showing anything for that.
So, they’re very conservative numbers.
 




My taxes will – first of all, I’ll have a much simpler tax statement. It will be much simpler.
When I do my return, it will be much – my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous. And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else.
We want to simplify them to a tremendous level.
The bracket of 25% – the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all – they’ve been there for years – are antiquated in many cases.
Or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they’re contributing to Bush. They’re contributing to every candidate but Trump. Because I’m not taking any money. I’m self-funding. And these people want these deductions.
There will be people – we’re reducing taxes. But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won’t be thrilled with this.
We’re taking away deductions and that’s one of the reasons we’re able to lower it.
 




This is actually a tax reduction. A big tax reduction, including for the upper income.
I believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won’t be getting certain deductions which aren’t fair for them to be getting that they’ll end up doing better.
 




I just think this is a common sense approach. You know, we could say supply side. You could say there’s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases. I don’t think it’s supply side or anything else.
I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that’s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work.
It’s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.
One of the other things that I’m coupling this with is if I become President, I’m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable.
We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There’s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn’t make a better deal. Everybody.
We lose money with everything.
I’m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world – Saudi Arabia – we protect everybody. We protect everybody.
And we don’t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything.
So, we’re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that’s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I’m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive.
As an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them.
So we need help.
We’re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion.
I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it’s $19 trillion and it’s only going up.
 




Well, no, look. Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight. We understand that. He wouldn’t be able to do this. He wouldn’t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they’re trying to take – we just went up in the last poll. We went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up.
In the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%. We’re going up very strongly in the polls. They don’t know what to do about it.
I’ve built a great company. You’ll see that in 60 Minutes last night. I built a great company. It’s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow.
I’m funding my own campaign.
Guys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money. Ask the car dealer in Florida. Ask the people that support him.
And a guy like Rubio and others – I don’t want to single him out; you’re singling him out – but they’re largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists.
I’ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it’s not the right thing. It’s just not right. And that seems to be resonating very strongly.


 




I negotiate. It’s true. I get bills from people; I’ll negotiate. Oh, is that a bad thing? The country should do that.
 




Yeah, I would. I’d bring that same attitude to the White House. It’s true.
She says I have a habit when you get a bill, you’d call up and you negotiate. To me, that’s a compliment.
No, I want to take that thinking to the White House. I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget. I could even save more. But we could save a tremendous amount.
That has to be the attitude our country has. You can’t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000.
You know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field. Okay? A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo. Okay? I don’t like that. What do you need $1 million for? Level out the surface, let them play – if they had to play at all. Okay? What do you need to spend $1 million.
We just spent – it’s a story today. $1 million on a soccer field. How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field? You have a level piece of land. Throw them a ball if they have to play soccer – if they have to play at all. Why are they playing soccer is my question.
 




No, it’s too long. You don’t have time. You don’t have time.
 




No, not at all. We’re lowering taxes, which Republicans love.
And I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons I’m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking.
No, we’re lowering taxes very substantially. We’re simplifying. And we’re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.
So, no, that’s not true.
 




Well, Putin was interviewed and I was interviewed last night. I thought his interview – I though Charlie Rose did an excellent job. But I thought his was a softer interview.
Scott Pelley interviewed me. I thought Scott was terrific. I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good.
 




Why is he harder on me than Putin? I would say because Putin is a nicer person than I am.
 




The worst in 36 years. Well, it’s a good question and you can connect the dots. But I guess it has been probably since ’04. You know, you’re talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country.
And again it’s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they’re going to other countries, taking jobs.
And now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies – very large, very prestigious companies as you know – obviously you know something about business. But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States.
You know, it used to be they’d move from New York to Florida. They’d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever.
Now, they’re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better.
And they’re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons – one of the big reasons – as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they’ve built up and they can’t get back into our country.
And when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it’s going to be put to work in our country, largely. It can go other places. But largely.
And I think it will be an amazing boon.
Now, here’s the other thing. They think it’s $2.5 trillion. I think it’s much more than that.
I actually think it’s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.


 




Well, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen.
 




Well, I’ll be announcing that in the not too distant future.
But I will tell you. I’ve been honest. I’m the only one that’s honest about this thing.
I watched Romney. I watched all – "Oh, I pay so much tax. I pay so much tax." I watched all politicians and they say "I pay – "
I fight like hell to pay as little as possible. Can I say that? I’m not a politician.
I fight like hell always because it’s an expense.
And you know, I feel – I fight. I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight. And I pay. But it’s an expense.
And frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain.
Our country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible. But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions.
All you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don’t feel so good about our country.
 




I’ll tell you what in terms of income inequality, we’re going to create a lot of jobs.
You know, right now, we have a false – 5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6% – every month it’s different.
It’s such a phony number. Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they’re taken off the roll. So the number isn’t reflective.
I’ve seen numbers of 24%. I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment. 42%.
And it could be because when you’re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can’t get the job – you know what I’m talking about because you’re shaking your head – and you can’t get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed.
So then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment. That is the biggest joke there is in this country.
That number is so false.
And you know, people ask "How come Trump is doing so well? And Carson and others? How come they’re doing -?" You know why they’re doing well? Because people are tired of political speak. They’re tired of that.
And the worst example of it – one of the worst example of it – is the phony unemployment rate.
The unemployment rate is probably 20%. But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it’s 30%, 32%. And the highest I’ve heard so far is 42%.
There’s anger out there at the job picture.
Now, one of the things – with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies.
That will stop. People will treat us fairly if I become President.
We’re losing our jobs. We’re losing our base. We’re losing our manufacturing.
All of that will stop.
 




Well, this is number one a simplification. Number two, what I’m really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs. They’re going to have an incentive also to stay in this country.
 




…Well, if they provide bigger dividends, people are going to have more money to spend. So that’s not so bad either.
If a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that’s great. Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, he’s going to have more money to spend in the economy. So that’s good.
 




I know nothing about that.
 




No, I’m not a populist. No, I’m not. I’m a man of great common sense. I’m a man that’s built a tremendous company with the best locations in real estate, the best everything. You’re here at one of them. I have many of these.
I’ve done a great job. I’ve employed tens of thousands of people. I employ now thousands and thousands of people. I’ve done a good job.
But I wouldn’t say populist at all. I would say I’m a man of common sense.
I’m cutting taxes. I’m going to create a lot of jobs. I’m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste.
And I’ll tell you what. The waste that I get rid of – the waste that I get rid of – is going to have a huge impact and I’m not even putting that in my numbers so I think it’s going to be terrific.
 




Yes, the motor industry. That’s a beautiful way of describing it – the motor industry.
Where are you from? England? I love them. Oh, what a beautiful accent.
No, I want to get the industry – we call it the automobile industry.
But I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here.
As you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico.
Mexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn’t.
I want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States.
I don’t want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else.
I want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where they’re leaving and they’re going to other countries.
I want them to stay here and they will stay here and they’ll be so happy.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. It’s been a great honor. Thank you.


Autism has become an epidemic.
25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics. Not even close.
It has gotten totally out of control.
I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.
Because you take a baby in – and I’ve seen it and I’ve seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump – I mean, it looks just like it’s meant for a horse not for a child.
And we’ve had so many instances – people that work for me just the other day – two years old, two and a half years old, a child – a beautiful child – went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.
I only say – I’m in favor of vaccines. Do them over a longer period of time. Same amount but just in little sections.
And I think you’re going to have – I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.


…Boy, oh, boy. I didn’t expect that. You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said "Would you come over and speak?"
I’m here for a certain reason. You know, it’s called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans – hundreds of thousands of veterans – I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that.
I didn’t expect it. I didn’t ask for it.
I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They’re our greatest people. They’re being treated terribly.
Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously – that’s what’s going on is incredible.
But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days.
And it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it’s not going to happen.
And one of the things I thought I’d do and I’d stress so strongly – the veterans hospitals – obviously they have problems. They’re not properly run.
And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say "I’m sorry. I’m going on vacation", believe me, it doesn’t get much worse than that.
So we’re going to create a whole new system. We’re going to take this system apart.
And if they’re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we’re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals.
And you’re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that’s going to be broken down into something that’s going to be very special.
Right now – and you know it – we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It’s not going to happen anymore. It’s not going to happen.
So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected.
To be here is an honor. They don’t build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don’t do them this way anymore.
I actually said what about recommissioning – look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa.
By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It’s been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They’re great.
So this is a great ship and that’s a great state.


I just want to say that we’re going to come out with some plans in a very short time.
We’re going to be building up our military. We’re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great.
And it will be so powerful that I don’t think we’re going to ever have to use it. Nobody’s going to mess with us. That I can tell you.
And we’re going to have a President who’s respected by Putin, who’s respected by Iran.
You know, let’s talk about for two seconds, let’s talk about the Iran deal.
Now, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran. Obama talks about the Supreme Leader. Well, I’m not calling him a Supreme Leader.
But he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again. "We’re finished with the United States."
They’re taking $150 billion. They’re getting a deal that’s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think.
They’re going to self-police – think about that one – they are going to go and self-police.
They’ve got the 24-day – they have 24-day provisions. And by the way, what people don’t understand – the 24-day provision doesn’t start – you know this, right? It doesn’t start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there.
It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I’ve ever seen of any kind.
So, we are going to do things and this country right.
We’re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there’s still there and we don’t even ask for them.
One of them is there because he’s a Christian. We have a writer. We have – the whole thing is absolutely insane.
You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe – you know, I’ve been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I’ve been saying it. But it’s possible – the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place.
It’s possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he’s going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance.
So we’re going to see what happens.
We have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration.
Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President.
And for two weeks, I said – you know, Rush Limbaugh – he’s a great guy – he said "He has suffered more incoming" – meaning the press – "than anybody I’ve seen."
So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I’m the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it’s a big problem. It is a big problem.
So you remember for about two weeks, I said, "Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President." And then you found out there’s tremendous crime. There’s tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country.


So the drugs pour in and the money pours out. Not a good deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. The drug cartels are going wild. They cannot believe how stupid our government is.
They are making a fortune. The drugs come in. The money goes out daily. And I saw it because I was on the border. I was there. And we saw it. And everybody sees it everyday.
And we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership. None. None whatsoever.
So, we’re going to build a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, believe me. You know, a lot of politicians have said "Oh, they’re not going to pay". They don’t know anything about – they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all.
So here’s the story. So here’s the story. I said the other day to one of my people "What is the United State’s trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China?"
So let’s start with China. Almost $400 billion a year.
Now, if you have a company where you’re losing $400 billion, you’ve got to do something very fast.
We don’t. We’ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades.
Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore.
With Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right? They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars – millions of cars – and we sell them beef. We sell them beef.
And they don’t want it because their farmers don’t want our beef. They protest and they send it back. All right?
It’s not going to happen that way anymore.
Now, with Mexico – and I love Mexico. I have many, many people – many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments.
Same with China. I have so many people. They pay me millions and millions. What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment? I don’t think so.
I had the largest bank in the world as a tenant. It’s from China. Bigger than any bank in this country by many times. They’re from China.
The problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they’re smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders.
I love free trade. The concept is great. But you need smart people.


I have the smartest people in this country lined up. I know the smartest.
I have Carl Icahn. I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it. They’re wealthy because they make good deals like me. I make good deals.
You know, it’s a talent. It’s a talent. You can’t be a politician.
Look, I’m fighting some very nice people. Very nice. Even though I’m leading in the polls. But they’re very nice people.
But they’re never going to do anything with these countries. They’re never going to be able to do it. It’s an instinct. It’s something that’s special. They don’t have it. Believe me, they don’t have it.
It’s just going to be more of the same.
So, we are going to make our country so great.
We are going to make it strong. We are going to make it powerful.
We’re going to rebuild the military. We’re going to make it so strong.
We are going to take care of our veterans.
And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day.
The other week – two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day. 31,000 people came to see us speak and we’re talking about making America great again.
Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20,000 people – the basketball arena of the Mavericks. 20,000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest. Everybody – think of it, 20,000 people – there wasn’t one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, "There’s got to be one."
There was a word – two words that used to be used a lot called "silent majority". They stopped using them.
The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different.
I don’t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they’re not silent. People are not silent.
They’re disgusted with our incompetent politicians.
They’re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away.
They’re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job.
They’re disgusted when they’re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they’re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country.
They’re disgusted when a woman who’s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years.
They’re disgusted by what’s happening to our country.
And you’re going to look around and you’re going to remember who the people are that are here because we’re doing something special. This is a movement. We’re going to make our country great again.
Believe me, we will make our country great again.
I love you all. Thank you very much.


Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor.
The Chairman just left as you probably know and he’s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period.
And as you know, that’s what I’ve wanted. I wanted fairness.
I don’t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party.
We’re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we’re over 30%. We’ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%.
And frankly, I’ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it’s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what’s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up.
And for that reason, I have signed the pledge.
So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win.
And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that’s what it’s all about. We have to make our country great again.






This is a self-funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don’t need money and I don’t want money.
And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other.
I’m not controlled by lobbyists. I’m not controlled by anybody. I’m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.






Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing.
The question was what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing. Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I’ve seen that over the last two months. They really have been very fair.






No, I have no intention of changing my mind.






Well, I think the big thing that’s changed is – and it’s been obvious to all – number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship.
Nobody thought I was going to run and they said "Oh, he won’t run and he won’t put in his papers. And he wouldn’t do all of this."
I did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It’s a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received.
And I think the thing that’s changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I’d be running for President.
So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect.
So that was very important.






No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.






Well, you don’t have to be met when you’re at 2%. It’s one of those things. That’s the way life works. And I like Gov. [Chris] Christie, by the way.






Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up. You saw him. He was here a little while ago. And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly.






Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we’re a nation that speaks English and I think that while we’re in this nation, we should be speaking English. And that’s how assimilation takes. And that’s how – I mean, whether people like it or not that’s how we assimilate and that’s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage.
And that’s how people that don’t speak – and I’m not just talking about Spanish; I’m talking about from various parts of the world – that’s how they will become successful and do great.
So I think it’s more appropriate to be speaking English.








Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it’s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws.
And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that.
And this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world.
When people come illegally, we cannot allow that.
And I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That’s been proven.
And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I’ve been proven right.
And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven’t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will.
The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We’re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws.
And we will make sure that that takes place.
With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States.
When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you’re not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay.
We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen.






I don’t know enough about it to comment on it. Was she jailed? I really don’t know much about it.






That’s absolutely false. I win at golf. I win at golf. That I can tell you.






Well, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody. I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants.
Don’t forget if I didn’t bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn’t be asking the question. Nobody would be even talking about immigration. And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor.
Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up.
But if I didn’t bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we’re talking about and it happens to be a very important subject.
I have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just – we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner.
But if I didn’t bring it up, nobody would be talking about it.






Well, there is gridlock in Congress right now and that’s because there’s no leadership at the top. You have to be able to lead. You have to be able to get people into your office. You have to get people go to them. Any way you want to do it. But you have to be able to lead. There is no leadership at the top.
Signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run.








I don’t want to talk about that. It’s inappropriate.






Tom Brady? Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine. He’s a great guy.
For those of you who don’t know him, he’s a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete. He is really a very good friend of mine.
And I just spoke to him a little while ago. He’s so thrilled and so happy.
Tom Brady – I think what they’ve done is terrible. And he’s been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it. But I’m very happy for Tom.
As far as the Commissioner is concerned, they’re having a rough year. Let’s face it. They’re having a very rough year.






Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming. And it’s a huge humanitarian problem.
And I just say this. This United States has tremendous problems of their own. We have infrastructure that we have to fix. We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart. Our nation’s in such trouble.
That’s why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help.
But we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have – health care, which is a mess.
You know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%. People are saying "This is turning out to be a disaster." Deductibles are through the roof. The deductibles on Obamacare it’s through the roof.
So we have a lot of problems. We have to take care of our vets. We have to build up our military.
Just the other day, Gen. [Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness.
Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton – and I’ve said she’s the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.
Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that’s about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place.
I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It’s going to lead to nuclear proliferation – the 24-day clause – everything about it. We don’t even get our prisoners back. You say who negotiates a thing like that?
That won’t happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump.






You’ll see it later. Yeah. They don’t want to hear it.






…I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else.
You see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person.
Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn’t supposed to run.
I’m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I’m not supposed to be running for office.
The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade.
And I’m not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us.
China – taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and we’re paying them interest.
We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount – $1.4 trillion.
Now, that’s like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That’s not going to happen with me.








…Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I’ll be honest. I think he’s a very nice person. I think he’s a very low energy person and I don’t think that’s what the country needs.
I hear he’s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me.
And honestly, look, he’s getting the money from special interests. He’s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they’re making him do it because he’s crashing in the polls.
So I don’t know what’s going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads – I don’t know. I know that my life will continue. I just don’t know. I mean nobody’s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I’ve done.
You know, one of the things I’m most honored about is that so far everybody that’s attacked me has gone down the tubes.
You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he’s at zero.
You have Perry attacked me. Now he’s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he’s getting out of the race. He was at zero.
Everybody – Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll – the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I’m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me.
Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big.
So I don’t know. Are they going to spend – he’s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this – they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money.
Nobody knows the system better than me. They have total control.
You understand it very well because you’ve been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate.
I will tell you this: Nobody’s putting up millions of dollars for me. I’m putting up my own money.
In fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you’re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like – am I a fool? I feel very foolish.
And when I was in Iowa last week, I said "What do you think? Can I take – " One man offered me – a big lobbyist – offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa – great crowd, 4,000 people – I said "Can I take it? And would you believe I’m not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won’t do anything." And they all stood up and said "No, no, don’t take it."
The fact is I’m the only self-funder. I’m putting up my own money.
I know there have been some super PACs – 5 or 6 super PACs – where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you’re not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don’t know what they’re going to do.
Hopefully, if they’re going to do something it’s going to be nice. But I don’t know anything about them.
But just in a nutshell, I’m funding my own campaign. Nobody else’s.
When people advertise – and I hope the voters can see this. Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests. So just remember that.






Our country could be doing much better. We have deficits that are enormous. We have all bad trade agreements. We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared. We have a military that needs help and especially in these times.
We have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don’t even work. Okay? If anybody saw that report. The phones don’t work. They’re 40 years old. They have wires that are no good.
Nothing works. Our country doesn’t work.
Everybody wins except us. We need victories in this country. We don’t have victories any more.
Our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems.






I think it’s great that she’s [Carly Fiorina] in the debate. I was in favor of her being – I think she should be in the debate.
I don’t like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it. They’re not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody. But I think they should because there’s too many people.
Because when you have 11, you’re not getting to hear me and you’re not getting to hear other people talking and I think that’s too bad. I think 11 is a lot of people.
But I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate.








I think maybe he’s [Joe Biden] inclined not to get in the race. I think it’s going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton.
A lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate. I don’t know that to be true.
But I think it depends on what happens with her.
I think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not.
Who knows?






Oh, he’s not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we’re very happy about that. We don’t want anything – and I told him. I said, "I don’t know if it’s appropriate Reince for you to be here because I don’t want anything – " You know, you guys will end up saying he’s endorsing Trump.
So I suggested frankly that I’m fine with him not being here because I don’t want anybody to think he’s endorsing.
As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it’s a little bit sad.
Don’t forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn’t have the energy.
But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists.
And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not – if I were him, I’d spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they’re at a point where they’re not going to leave because they’re fed up with what’s happening in this country, but I think they’re going to go to people other than Jeb.






I don’t know. Right now, I’m interested in jobs. One thing – one of the groups, it was actually CNN. I shouldn’t say that. But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing.
And I don’t mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country.
You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million.
When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people.
We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all.
Our country can be great again. We have to put people back to work.






Would I bring my children into the administration? I will tell you they are very capable. The answer is probably not. But having them in would be very good. They’re very, very capable children.
The second part I won’t bother asking you. It’s no longer pertinent.






Kanye West? You know what? I’ll never say bad about him. You know why? Because he loves Trump. He loves Trump. He goes around saying "Trump is my all-time hero." He says it to everybody.
So, Kanye West – I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I’ll have to run against him. I don’t know. So I’ll take that back.
But he’s been so nice to me.
You people have sort of seen because I’ve been a counter-puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me.






No, my supporters are really supporting me because I’m very competent, because they know that I’m not going to let China rip us off. I’m not going to let Japan rip us off.
Japan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu – their big tractor maker – and others. We’re not going to let this happen anymore.
They do – you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you’ve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I’ve never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don’t even want it.
It’s going to end and they’re going to like us.
In this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It’s a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world.
I get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico.
I love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics – many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships.
And in the package that we gave you, you’ll see there’s a poll and I’m number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics.
So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We’re going to be great to the vets. We’re going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable.
All of these things – we’re going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that’s much better and much less expensive. We’re going to get rid of it. We’re going to repeal it. It’s going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened.
But we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we’re going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I’ll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. And here is your pledge.


…I’m going to tell you a story about Nashville. You’re not even going to believe it. But it’s a very personal story. It’s a very special place to me for a very special reason.
But maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us. She’s 92 years old. We don’t talk about age but she’s 92. And she looks magnificent. And her name is Beada and she’s become very famous. You know who Beada is, right?
Beada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful.
So, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life. She hasn’t seen anybody that really did it to her. And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she’s going to vote for Trump. I think, right?
Thank you, darling. I really appreciate it. You know, she’s become so famous. She’s on television all over the world now.
I have to be nervous even talking to her, you’re so famous. It’s great.
Beada, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it.
Because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we’re going to take this country back and we’re going to make this country so great again and so strong again.
…Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville. So, years ago – many years ago – like I hate to say 40 but I won’t say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain.
And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good.
But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that’s what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly.
I shouldn’t say that because you’re not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right?
But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee.
And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything.
And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it’s one of the great buildings of the world and it’s one of the great successes.
And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience.
And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know, when you’re leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you’re not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don’t want you at all.
And we’ll talk about the polls in a second.
But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let’s do this.
And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my – it’s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it’s so important and it’s been such a great – from the day I built it it was a home run. And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee. So, I really – it’s an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you. Real honor.


So, coming over I heard and I watched television – you know, they have all these cameras back there and they’re live. And I guess we’re live on CNN, we’re live on so many different things. It’s always difficult. You know, when you’re always live, you’ve got to change up your speech. You can’t make the speech over and over…
The other candidates don’t get covered live ever, except for the debate.
So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they’ll be even substantially higher than that.
So I would’ve said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN – that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity.
When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now – maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research – so many of this – there’s so many good – Alzheimer’s – you know, there’s so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I’m not showing up.
You know, it’s interesting. So they’ll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they’ve been doing them for a long time. They don’t do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression – it draws flies? That’s what it draws.
So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television.
Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should.
So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it’s not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don’t know.
Here’s the thing. If I don’t do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don’t care about CNN. Honestly. No, they’re going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera.
They’re actually very nice.
But they’re going to make a lot of money and, you know, it’s something we should consider. So we’ll all consider it together.
But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they’re DREAMERs.
And I said, "What about our children?" Why can’t our children that are in the country, why can’t they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that.
You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets.
You know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases…are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have.
And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it’s wonderful – " you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what’s happening.
This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that’s possible too.
They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there’s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there’s nobody there. And the veterans – I don’t know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying "Where are the people?"
And then, they said, "What happened?" And they said, "This happens all the time." There was not even – nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor.
When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I’m like "Get me – " I’d go crazy. It’s true.
Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house? Right?


Beada remembers that. You’d have a cold. The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top. And he’d come over to your house, check you out, fine. Those days don’t exist anymore.
You know, we’re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists.
By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you.
But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor’s office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days.
One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation.
Now, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days.
So the wait’s now the longest in history and that’s the way we’re treating our greatest people and that’s not right and we’re going to change that. We’re going to change that.
We have right now – and people don’t know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness.
You know, I’m a Republican. I’m a conservative. But I’m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens – they become weak. You know, they go to Washington – "We’re going to stop Obamacare. We’re going to stop this. We’re going to do this. We’re going to do that."
Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go "Oh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I’ll do whatever you want me to do. I’m in Washington."
It’s amazing. Isn’t it amazing? Don’t you agree?
I won’t happen to me, I promise.
And if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won’t. I promise. I promise.
But you know, they show those phony statistics where we’re 5.4% unemployment. 5.4%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not.
But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking.
So if you’re looking for a job and you can’t find it and you stop for a while – you know, after a while you sort of like "It’s not happening. It’s not going to happen." I don’t know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay?
So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It’s hard to believe.
We have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money.
Japan’s taking our money.
Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they’re killing us on trade. You know that.
In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have…
[Comment on a supporter’s sign]
You know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don’t want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It’s about doing the right thing.
One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we’re leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening.
We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech – that’s like luck. That’s from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable.
And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire.
Leading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we’re leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who’s sitting, you have a governor who’s been there for eight years and Trump – ? I love Florida and I’m there a lot. What could be in Florida? Great weather. You have great weather but Florida has great weather. Big advantage.


But you know, I’m leading big in Florida.
But one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I’m leading really big.
And in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability – you know, I’m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say – I think I had one poll where I’m 41% – almost 41% – can you imagine? 41%. There’s 17 people. So I’m at 41% with 17 people and they said "Trump’s at 41% but look" – you can’t even hear it. You know, "Trump says bleh". Nobody knows what they just said.
"But there are some people that don’t like him."
It’s unbelievable. I’m the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity. No, it’s incredible. The press, ayeyayay.
…Well, yesterday, you might have seen me. I was in South Carolina. I made a speech. I had to bring it up.
The New York Times to me is a big deal. You know, I’m from New York. Very liberal paper but that’s okay. You know, not everybody could be like us. But it’s still the New York Times. Right? We have to admit, still the New York Times.
And I’m on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal.
But yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator. Low level guy. This one didn’t like me.
By the way, I think I’m going to win the Hispanic vote and I think – you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me.
I love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many – I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They’re great people.
And I said, "I’m going to win". And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don’t want people coming in illegally. You know it’s true. It’s true.
So there’s this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we’re way up and Lindsey at 4% and he’s the Senator. I’m at 30%. So I wrote him a note, "Congratulations. I’m only beating you in your home state by 26 points."
So anyways, who cares.
But they did something that nobody reported. They say, "Oh but do people like Trump?" By the way, this election is not going to be like.
I think I’m a nice person. I love people. I want to help people.
Women’s health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn’t important because he didn’t want to fund them. And then he said, "Oh, I misspoke."
But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person.
But I think it’s actually going to be an election based on competence. We’re tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it’s time.
But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. Highly re – "In another act of political magic…Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative" – nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. "From negative to positive."
This is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don’t need – but I want to be sure because if I used the word "the" incorrectly, they’ll say, "He didn’t – "
"Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month". A feat that Monmouth University’s Patrick Murray’s highly respected pollster called "astounding".
Called it "astounding." Nobody else wrote about it.
"That defies any rule in presidential politics that I’ve ever seen," said this highly respected man.
Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he’s never seen that before.
And you know what? That’s because people have heard me and they say "You’re such a nice person." No, they want – they say he’s a man – I’ve made a tremendous amount of money. I’ve had tremendous success. And I don’t say that braggingly. That’s the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is.
But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody.
And we are more than double everybody.


You saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll. I was the same thing. Much, much higher – double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates.
And the reason is people in this country are smart. They don’t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people – you know, why are they doing this? I mean, why are they even saying it?
You’d think that if somebody’s good for the country – and I’ll be great for the country because I’m going to make great deals for our country. We don’t win anymore. Our country doesn’t win anymore.
You’d think somebody – even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal. Somebody who’s going to make the country – why are they knocking it? Why are they knocking? Why do they fight?
You’d think they’d say "Let’s do it. It’s good. It’s good for all of us."
Because our country is in trouble. We owe now $19 trillion. You know, I’ve been saying $18 [trillion] for a while now. But now it starts to go up quickly.
And by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in ’16, you want to see bad deficits? You want to see it go up? You’re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it’s no good.
Have you noticed – and you’ve seen it yourself – the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility – unless you’re close to death, you’re never going to use it. You can’t use it because the deductibility is so high.
But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It’s a disaster.
And on top of that, it’s going to cost the country a fortune. So it’s not only costing you a lot of money, it’s going to cost the country a fortune.
So we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it.
But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won’t mention names, some of them when they hear my name – I was talking – we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us. Okay? Who came down. And she actually said "Some of them when they hear your name it looks like they’re a boiler waiting to explode." It’s true.
…Now, number one, they look bad because they said – do you remember the beginning? Like three, four months ago. They said, "He’s a clown. He’s a clown. Just having fun."
You know, I went to a great school. I did great. I did – everything was great. I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune.
I then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody.
I jokingly say but I mean it – the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it’s true. Nothing tops the Bible.
But the Art of the Deal – great success. Many books – bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers.
Then I do The Apprentice. I’ve never done television. I do The Apprentice. It’s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way.
And NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me.
They came up to my office, the head of Comcast – great guy – I won’t use names. Just say "Steve". No, honestly he’s a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, "Donald, we’re renewing The Apprentice. Please, you’ll have to do – you have to do it."
I said, "Honestly, Steve, I’m running for President. I want to make our country great again. I want to make -"
And they didn’t believe me. And I said it four times. They didn’t believe me. Nobody believed that I was going to run. Nobody.
My wife didn’t even believe me, but now she does. But she actually said "If you actually say you’re going to run, you’re going to do great because people like you." She actually said "They’d love you" but I don’t want to brag. But she said, "If you actually run – not you may run, you may not run, who knows?" But she said "If you actually say -"
So the NBC guys come up – terrific people. I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows.
In fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice. So Mark Burnett, who’s a great guy, he calls up and he goes "I don’t believe it. You’re not taking a renewal." The word is renewal. I said, "That’s right, Mark. I’m going to run for President." "No, no, no, you have to – nobody doesn’t take a renewal. It’s unheard of in primetime television. Two hours primetime. Are you crazy?" I said, "Mark, I have to do this. I’ve done so well in this country. I have to do it."


We can save our country. We can save our country.
So anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it. I told them I’m not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced.
They don’t like me anymore. It’s amazing. They do not like me.
But it’s too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you.
You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice – there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, "Why do you think that is?" I said "Because I’m special." And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically – I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing.
But so I had a great experience. So here I am – great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said "It will never be successful" because you know to have a big hit – a really a number one hit – you have to – and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women.
And I’ll never forget – I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, "Truman loses" and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said "Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?" And I said, "Am I so bad? Am I so bad?" Tell me, am I so bad?
And it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked…So you know I saved those things.
But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it’s going to be hard. It’s going to be a lot of work. It’s going to be a lot of time. I wouldn’t leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You’re elected President. You’re in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I’d maybe never leave! How cool is that?
He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I’ll try – I don’t know maybe there’s some rules against it. So maybe I can’t. But I’ll do the fundraisers in the White House.
He and his wife left – I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows.
And I say why? Why aren’t they flying at least the same plane?
Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes…More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, "Let’s do it from the White House." This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don’t spend any money of the taxpayers.
…And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. "We’re doing our show live from the White House or something".
So we don’t pay any money. We don’t have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you – do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things? With hundreds and hundreds of security and you’re closing down Burbank, California.
I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say "What’s going on? You can’t move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city."
And he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I’m buying which is only a couple of blocks.
…It’s true. I’m building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it’s going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say "What’s going on? How did Trump get it?"
One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they’re the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we’re building this phenomenal hotel – Trump International Hotel – right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It’s going to open just in time – and by the way, listen to this one. We’re under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget.
So we’re actually going to be opening and it’ll be great. But he can use my hotel. I’ll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don’t have to do that.
But you’d say to yourself why – you know, it’s a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don’t want to waste time. You’ve got to do this. You’ve got to make deals.


I’ve got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us. Carl Icahn – incredible guy. Right? Incredible guy. Great deal maker.
I’ve got some of the greatest deal makers in the world. They’re all calling me too. They said "You didn’t ask me."
I have these guys calling me up – the best in the world.
Now, I know the best. I also know guys that are overrated. I know guys that you haven’t heard of that honestly are phenomenal. I know a lot that you have heard of that aren’t really that good, that are overrated in my opinion.
But they’re the best in the world. And they’re calling me. They don’t want money. They’re worth billions of dollars.
But when I put, let’s say, Carl Icahn and I’ll say "Carl, do me a favor. Handle China." We’re going to make a great deal. No, no, we’re going to make a great deal because that’s what happens. You know, that’s what happens.
So, we’re going to take back our trade.
If you look at China, if you look at Japan – I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships – the biggest ships I’ve ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything’s nice. Except that it doesn’t help us. When does it help us? When does it help us?
We sell them beef. Beef. And then they don’t want it. Because you know, do you ever see what’s going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it’s very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over "We don’t want it."
They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships.
And I say, "What are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing."
And I’m a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade.
When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It’s like peanuts.
Balance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it.
A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has – it’s probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They’ve taken our money. They’ve taken our jobs. They’ve taken everything. They’ve taken so much.
And they’re creating a bubble and you know interestingly we’re so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might.
And we’ve got to be smart.
I made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China.
The Bank of America building in San Francisco – I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows.
You know, all these guys come to Forbes. "Oh, Trump’s worth only $5 billion or $4 billion." Or whatever. "He’s only worth $5 billion." It’s like a bankrupt magazine…They don’t even know my numbers. They said, "Well, we haven’t been able to look at about 400 of his companies."
So I filed. Interestingly, they said "He’ll never run. He’ll never run."
…Then I announced. Then they said, "Oh, he’ll never file his form whatever." That’s a single page where basically you’re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement.
I signed my form. And they said, "Well, he’ll never ever put in his financials." And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, "He’ll ask for extensions but he’ll never show because he’s probably not as rich as people think."
But actually I’m much richer and I put in my financials – it’s true. It’s true.
And Forbes and another group said, "No, no, we don’t know what these companies are."
I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn’t going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It’s such a great company I’ve built.
So they said, "He’ll never put in his financials." I put in the financials. And everybody – they’re much bigger. It’s a much bigger – you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I’m very proud of it.
But they say, "He’ll never file. He’ll never file."
Then they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn’t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, "Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?" The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more.
So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that.
So it says "$50 million or more". So I checked many of them. I don’t know how many. I think there’s 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don’t know, I think it’s 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they’ll kill me if I’m wrong. But I’m not sure. But I think it’s like 23 boxes. $50 million or more.
So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion.


So it says "$50 million or more", I go 50. So they’ll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more.
And they add them up and they say "Well, he’s worth $2.9 billion." It’s really – this is the press. And they have no clue. Those statements aren’t really meant for me – it’s not meant for a guy like me.
But with all of that the statements were so good. They’re so good. They’re so good.
And you know, one of the things I’m doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing?
…Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets.
But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn’t know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign.
So all over the place, I’m spending millions of dollars. I’m turning down millions. I don’t want your money. I don’t want your money.
Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn’t have to make. But they put it up. It’s all over CNN. "Trump is asking for $100."
I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy – Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He’ll sell you a car any day of the week, right?
And you know the guy is – like 2,000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they’re serving.
So they put up a sign. I don’t want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That’s hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story – "Trump accepting contributions".
I can’t believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it’s like peanuts. It doesn’t mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do.
The bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign. I’m self-funding. I don’t want to have anybody giving. I don’t need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it’s not a lot of money but it’s great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money.
But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1,000. But it doesn’t amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign.
How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? "Dear So and So, I’m sorry I don’t really want your money." How do you write a letter like that?
I want them to invest in it. You know, but they’re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million.
I had a big lobbyist asked me to have – he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down.
And then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there’s a sign – $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they’re doing this big thing about all day long last night about – I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that’s the press. That’s the media.
Yeah, the criminal media. I mean, there’s truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it’s wrong.
But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2,000 people. It had to be a record.
The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don’t forget.
When I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I’m leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow. You have not been treated fairly. No, you haven’t been treated fairly.
You have not been treated fairly.


You know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back. You people don’t.
The Tea Party people are incredible people. These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media. It’s disgusting.
And you will be surprised how big you are. You don’t know how big you are. You don’t know the power that you have. I mean it. You don’t know the power that you have.
The Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want. I don’t care about names. But the Tea Party has tremendous power.
I talked silent majority. But the silent majority is more than Tea Party. It’s Democrats. It’s poor people. It’s rich people. It’s everybody. It’s evangelicals.
One of the things that made me so happy – I’m a protestant. I’m a presbyterian. Right? – is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful – like these polls are great. You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters. They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. What do you have to do that for? Every week they come out with a new poll. Right?
Hey, I’m rich. I could hire a hundred poll. I don’t want to waste money. You know, why should I pay?
I know in one case…like $150,000 a month. And you know, then they’re arrogant guys. They think they’re hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say. "You’ve got to say this. You’ve got to be politically correct."
No way. I don’t have time to be political. No, it’s true. It’s true.
I don’t have time to be political. You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct.
You saw the anchor baby thing. Did you see that with where I’m on? And somebody from…it’s the same network – CNN again – he said, "You know the name anchor baby is very insulting?" I said, "What would you call it?" And he gave me like nine words. "A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that." I said, "How can I say that? It’s too long."
It’s anchor baby.
And then Bush – Jeb. Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person. Honestly.
If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won’t talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person.
So Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo. You know, don’t say this, don’t say that. All these things. Pages of stuff.
But one of the things – "Never use the term ‘anchor baby’."
So all of a sudden, he’s using the term anchor baby just last week.
And with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me. They expect me. They gave up. Okay?
With him, they killed him. They just killed him. It didn’t stop.
And then he blamed it on the Asians. He said, you know – did you see that? And then the New York Times did an editorial "How dare you attack the Asians?"
So he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics. He said, "Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies." And now the Asians all hate him. It’s true.
But the Asians love me and I love them. I love them.
So he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says – a couple of years ago – "Don’t use this term", and now he’s using it because he has to.
Because baby – you know, think of it. Think of it. I want to build a wall. Okay? So easy. So easy. When this clown – Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name – no, he’s a baseball player. Ramos. Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player. He’s a nice baseball player. But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters. Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming.
So I even had liberal people from CBS – I actually said to the CBS guy "Yes?" and this guy stands up and starts screaming.
So when he – and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him. I didn’t do anything like – I didn’t do anything. Except for the Times. And that’s what I alluded to before. The Times said, "Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him." I didn’t scream at him. But he was screaming at me.
And much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don’t wear a toupee, and I proved it – I won’t bring anybody up. I won’t bring anybody up. But I don’t.
But think of it. I’m in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer – this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of – saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don’t.


So, I’m on the front page of the New York Times. I can’t even talk about it. I’m embarrassed to talk about it.
But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million. They didn’t mention that.
They also didn’t mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Did you know that? His daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Oh, you didn’t know that. Oh. No, they didn’t mention that. No, no.
They said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn’t. No, he’s screaming at me.
So we very nicely – and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk. He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit. You know, he’s a very emotional man.
But, he said, "You can’t build a wall because you can’t do it."
So, 2,000 years ago in China – we always get back to China – 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China – oh, we’d like to have a wall. This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don’t go through so easy.
They built a wall 2,000 years ago that’s 13,000 miles. Think of that. That’s a big wall. That’s serious wall, right? This was 2,000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit – you know, took a long time. But 13,000 miles that’s a long time. They had no tractors. They didn’t have Caterpillars.
Of course, today, we use Komatsus because they’re made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar’s stock is down. It’s terrible. We’ll change that around. Believe me. Believe me.
But, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15 – I would say – look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000. But you don’t need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places.
And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn’t.
Because I’m a great builder. What I do best is build. I’m not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I’m the opposite. I get it built.
So, one of the reasons it couldn’t get built is because they couldn’t get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn’t get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall.
And they’re killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people.
Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family.
Last week in California, a 66-year-old veteran – a female, a veteran, 66 – got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66-years-old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily.
But this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That’s why the hat is so successful. The white one, right?
But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn’t sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing.
But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it’s rough stuff, it’s rough stuff.
And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press.
Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said "Trump has received more incoming than any human being I’ve ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he’s going to apologize and he doubles down."
I got credit. I got credit.
No, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don’t mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right.
So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming…In fact that was my first two weeks. I said "Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half?" I don’t know if I can make it. It was brutal.
Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they’ve apologized to me. Everybody says I’m right. And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration. They wouldn’t even be talking about it. They wouldn’t even be talking about it.


And we’re going to build a wall and we’re going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They’re going to be out so fast.
One of the first thing I’m going to do is get rid of those gang members. We’re going to be – you know, you look at what’s going on with Baltimore, you look at what’s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin.
You know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys – we need law and order. We need law and order.
I mean, they allowed – in one night, that first night in Baltimore – they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren’t allowed to protect people.
We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be – the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He’s a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they’re allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me.
We have some incredible people. But we have to be tough. We have to be smart.
You know, I know you’re going to have some bad apples. You’re going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it’s disgusting and it’s horrible. But that’s such a tiny percentage.
The problem is the good work doesn’t get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99.9%.
I mean, the good work with the police. It’s 99.9%. That one little thing.
And it’s horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don’t have to go into them. But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was.
But we need law and order. We need our police. They’re great people. They do a phenomenal job. They’re right now afraid of doing anything. They’re afraid.
I mean, I know cities. I won’t mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don’t want to be thrown off the police force.
And then you wonder why there’s crimes in our cities.
So we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it.
We also have to focus on what we have – look, Ukraine. I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good. But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries. We’re now sending F-22s. That’s the newest fighters. The best in the world. We’re sending fighters every – Where’s Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree.
But why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn’t hate us. I think he’d like me. I’d get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn’t like him in all fairness. They don’t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I’d get along with these people.
Think of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they’re going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that.
So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay?
But think of it. So, Ukraine – let’s take a few of these things and then I’m getting the hell out of here; I’m going back to New York. Do you mind? Maybe I’ll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight. Can I do that?
I’d actually rather – I love – by the way, this is not a politician speaking. Believe me. I hope. I love country music. I love it. Hey, Trace Adkins – right? And who else won on The Apprentice? Who else? John Rich. My kids love those two guys. John Rich. And who else? Who did really well? Clint Black. Right? Clint Black. He did great. And my Trace – how good is Trace, okay?
You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, "Who the hell is he? Who is he?" I didn’t know who Trace was. I’d never heard of him. And he wasn’t a big name. And he came on – just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now…it went to number one. And then he came to me the next year…but Trace came to me and he goes – you know, at certain awards show, I won’t mention the name – but he said "Last year, I couldn’t get into the show and this year I’m hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you."
Nice, right? I know, nice.
But those three guys, they’re great and they’re just fantastic people.
But we’ve got to make our country so strong. We have to make our country rich again.
A person came up and said, "Oh, that’s not nice." What’s not nice? They said rich, you know, to say we’re going to make our country rich.


We can’t make our country great if we’re going to be poor. We’re a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion.
China – think of this – China we owe $1.4 trillion to. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion. How do you do that? That’s like a magic act. Right? It’s true.
Japan sells us cars by the millions. They make a fortune. They come in, they sell us cars by the millions. And we owe them the exact same amount. We owe them $1.4 trillion. How come if they’re selling us cars we owe them money? Think of it. Put on your business. See? I have a natural instinct for this stuff. Right? You know? Right?
If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money? But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds. And we’re paying interests on them and we owe them money.
So, it’ll change. It can change. It’s not even going to be hard.
People don’t realize. See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal. People don’t realize.
Oh, and somebody said Sharon. It was Sharon. Where’s Sharon? She gave me such a hard time. Where’s Sharon? Where the hell is she? You could have both Sharons stand up actually. Where are they? Both of them. Sharon is great. Oh, did they go after her…She took a lot of incoming. Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming? I think so. Right? Thank you, darling.
So, we are going to do something that if I get elected – and again they said I’ll never run and now…One guy said – John McLaughlin – you ever watch the McLaughlin Report? I like him.
And one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he’ll never make it as a President. He’ll never get elected. He’ll never make it. And John McLaughlin – this crusty guy who I like; I don’t know him. I never met him, I don’t think. But I like. He’s sitting there and he goes – and he got angry – he goes "Why wouldn’t he make it? You tell me why. He’s been a tremendous success in everything he’s done. I go all over the world. I see him name. I see his name all over. He’s a great success."
And he said – I think this is the word – "He’s a man of great achievement. Why wouldn’t he make it?"
And I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up. You know, because you need somebody of great achievement.
You need – I’ve produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year. I don’t have to worry about Obamacare. I take such good care of my employees. I have thousands of employees. I take good care of them. We have great plans. My employees are lucky. They hit the lotto, okay? But I take great care – education and health care – and my people are very happy.
But I’ve done this for a long time, and I’ve seen ups and downs. I’ve seen market crashes. I’ve seen friends of mine go bankrupt. You’ve never seen – I’ve never gone bankrupt. By the way, I’ve used the laws to my advantage and companies.
I buy a company. I throw it into a chapter. I negotiate with banks. I kill. You know. And then they say "Trump goes bankrupt." These people – they don’t have any –


Now, when other people do that, when a Carl does it – I mean, they do it all the time. They use it all the time. It’s called using your head. It’s called using the laws.
Actually I did a good job didn’t I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said – I do what every other great businessman does.
I buy a company – you know, it’s one company was sort of interesting. A friend of mine had it. Good guy. And the banks were just killing him. They were mean. And banks can be mean, right?
You’ve got to teach them how to behave, right?
So this guy was just getting beaten. And I did him a favor and I called up the banks. And I said "Do me this, do this, do this, do that." They said, "We won’t do that. No, we won’t do that."
I said, "You’re making a mistake." Anyways, it’s sort of a little bit complicated…I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, "Don’t do this." I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story "Trump files bankruptcy". Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank – ayeyeye.
They see me walking down the street and they go "Hey, hey, hey." But then I’m good at that stuff, you know? I’m really good at that stuff.
But you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage.
Atlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar’s went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar’s? Caesar’s filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things.
I said, "Don’t go into Iraq" even though I’m a very militaristic person. I said "Don’t go into Iraq" and they shouldn’t have because I said you’re going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get – $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5,000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place.
We can’t even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we’re giving them, they’re going to take off and they’re going to get the oil, they’re going to get everything. The oil they don’t get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing.
So I had vision in 2004 – Reuters – actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don’t do Iraq.
Now, I’m much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use.
So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That’s called vision. I should get credit for vision.
And again, this isn’t bragging. Normally, I wouldn’t say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that?
I mean, normally I wouldn’t. So I got great credit. I got out.
But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they’re bankrupt. They went bankrupt.
But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it.
Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win.
We are going to have victories again. We are going to win.
In fact, last night in front of the audience and I’ve never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we’re going to have so many victories.
And then I said we’re going to win here. We’re going to win on trade.
We’re going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody’s going to play with us. Nobody’s going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody.
And we’re going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out…In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore…And everyone stood up and said "No, no, no, we want to keep winning."
If I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything.
I will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid. We are going to have something that’s so special.
And you know, my whole fame is and I’ll say it once. We will make America truly great again.
And thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much!


Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.
So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system — we are in a rigged, rigged system — and to make America safe again and to make America great again.
I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop.
We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen.
I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.
And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot — a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.
Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing.
Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.
We also need to bring back in this country — because we see what happened — our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back.
I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous — really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.
But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person.
Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control.
Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary.
And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails — but it wasn't a loss, she discarded — that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.
Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.
But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that.
On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it.
What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.
Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over.
And Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order.
Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking — I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money.
But I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean — but — but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made.
You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.
And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters — about 30 percent of them — said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.
So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike — and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close.
Now, this wasn't close. This was — in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got — I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger — I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger — we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.
Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes.
But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people — because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.
But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who — many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.
They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start — and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put them back to work.
So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that — delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112- 12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've — they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen.
And what we're doing...
And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud — and nobody else would even think about doing it — I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals — and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart.
And I said — and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president.
And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.
I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top — the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders — people are going to be surprised to hear that — I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?
And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.
And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start?
And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right.
Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going to — they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall.
So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55 percent, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.
I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't — he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.
I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.
I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible.
Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK?
And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK?
It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.
And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy.
But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike.
Indiana's unemployment rate — and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family — Karen is amazing.
Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state.
And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual.
Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.
It's also rated AAA, their bonds are rated AAA. Very few states have that. AAA. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, AAA.
Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.
And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor.
Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.
If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said really — they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on — they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal.
Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with — you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact.
So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got them jobs. Got them jobs.
Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy.
Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K- 12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing?
Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you better get rid of Common Core fast.
Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.
So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much — look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?
You know, it's very interesting. We're building — we're building — I won the — which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing — probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened.
We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.
But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year — actually more than a year — we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.
And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them.
So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work — also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke — who's now at Purdue — when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened — almost has not happened in this whole country.
The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted — who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy — but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?
So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non- endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you.
So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.



It is great to be here. I’d like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us. Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again.
We are thirty miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.
The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.
But our workers’ loyalty was repaid with betrayal.
Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization – moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.
Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.
When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.
For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment.
Many of these areas have still never recovered.
Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.
Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.
Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.
This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can turn it all around – and we can turn it around fast.
But if we’re going to deliver real change, we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.
The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything – and say anything – to keep things exactly as they are.
The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change.
The inner cities will remain poor.
The factories will remain closed.
The borders will remain open.
The special interests will remain firmly in control.
Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small – and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.

My campaign has the opposite message.
I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again.
I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who’ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another.
Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.
I was on the right side of that issue – with the people – while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong.
Now it’s time for the American people to take back their future.
That’s the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton’s campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America.
We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.
America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer.
The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.
But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations.
We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable.
Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.
I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.
Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.
This is not some natural disaster. It is politician-made disaster.
It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.
This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.
Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade
George Washington said that “the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.”
Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the “expediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.” The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: “The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… must produce want and ruin among our people.”
Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs – emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.
Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.
We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.
As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before.
Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time to declare our economic independence once again.
That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years.
America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 – even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people.
At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.
NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.
It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it.
It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China’s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement.
Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.
The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO.
Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time.
Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China.
It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.
As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton “Voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.”
Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.
To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.
Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product.
From 1947 to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.
However, since 2002 – the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports – that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.
What does this mean for Americans? For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.
America’s “job creation deficit” due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs – and that’s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages.
The Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet.
The TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing.
It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.
It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters. It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets – while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.
The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.
The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth.
Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.
The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can’t veto.
These commissions are great Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes.
It should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a “leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership”.
She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the “gold standard”.
Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too – but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed.
She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career.
Here’s how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through.
That’s why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP “in its current form,” – ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.
If the media doesn’t believe me, I have a challenge for you. Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.
There is no way to “fix” the TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.
A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy – quickly
Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.
One: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.
Two: I’m going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.
Three: I’m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.
Four: I’m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don’t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better. If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.
Five: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply
Six: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China’s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.
Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield America’s semiconductor industry was 100%.
Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. She has it completely backwards.
Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another – from NAFTA to China to South Korea.
A Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people.
The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
A new era of prosperity will finally begin.
America will be independent once more.
Under a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them.
We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job.
We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory.
This includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.
We will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity.
Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.
We are also going to fully capture America’s tremendous energy capacity. This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.
A Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure.
Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State building.
It will be American steel that will fortify American’s crumbling bridges.
It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky.
It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities.
It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy – mined from American resources – that powers this country.
It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.
We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.
On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again.
We are going to make America wealthy again.
We are going to reject Hillary Clinton’s politics of fear, futility, and incompetence.
We are going to embrace the possibilities of change.
It is time to believe in the future.
It is time to believe in each other.
It is time to Believe In America.
This Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again – For All Americans.
We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone – Greater Than Ever Before.
Thank you.
